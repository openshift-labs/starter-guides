## Lab: Scaling and Self Healing

### Background: Deployment Configurations and Replication Controllers

While *Services* provide routing and load balancing for *Pods*, which may go in and
out of existence, *ReplicationControllers* (RC) are used to specify and then
ensure the desired number of *Pods* (replicas) are in existence. For example, if
you always want your application server to be scaled to 3 *Pods* (instances), a
*ReplicationController* is needed. Without an RC, any *Pods* that are killed or
somehow die/exit are not automatically restarted. *ReplicationControllers* are
how OpenShift "self heals".

A *DeploymentConfiguration* (DC) defines how something in OpenShift should be
deployed. From the https://{{DOCS_URL}}/architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployments documentation]:

Building on replication controllers, OpenShift adds expanded support for the
software development and deployment lifecycle with the concept of deployments.
In the simplest case, a deployment just creates a new replication controller and
lets it start up pods. However, OpenShift deployments also provide the ability
to transition from an existing deployment of an image to a new one and also
define hooks to be run before or after creating the replication controller.
__

In almost all cases, you will end up using the *Pod*, *Service*,
*ReplicationController* and *DeploymentConfiguration* resources together. And, in
almost all of those cases, OpenShift will create all of them for you.

There are some edge cases where you might want some *Pods* and an *RC* without a *DC*
or a *Service*, and others, so feel free to ask us about them after the labs.

### Exercise: Exploring Deployment-related Objects

Now that we know the background of what a *ReplicatonController* and
*DeploymentConfig* are, we can explore how they work and are related. Take a
look at the *DeploymentConfig* (DC) that was created for you when you told
OpenShift to stand up the `parksmap` image:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get dc

NAME       REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
parksmap   1          1         1         config,image(parksmap:{{PARKSMAP_VERSION}})
----

To get more details, we can look into the *ReplicationController* (*RC*).

Take a look at the *ReplicationController* (RC) that was created for you when
you told OpenShift to stand up the `parksmap` image:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get rc

NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
parksmap-1   1         1         0         4h
----

This lets us know that, right now, we expect one *Pod* to be deployed
(`Desired`), and we have one *Pod* actually deployed (`Current`). By changing
the desired number, we can tell OpenShift that we want more or less *Pods*.

OpenShift's *HorizontalPodAutoscaler* effectively monitors the CPU usage of a
set of instances and then manipulates the RCs accordingly.

You can learn more about the CPU-based
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.html[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler here]

### Exercise: Scaling the Application

Let's scale our parksmap "application" up to 2 instances. We can do this with
the `scale` command. You could also do this by clicking the "up" arrow next to
the *Pod* in the OpenShift web console on the overview page. It's your choice.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 dc/parksmap
----

You can also scale up to two pods by clicking the up arrow in the web console as shown in the following image:

image::parksmap-scaleup.png[Scaling]

To verify that we changed the number of replicas, issue the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get rc

NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
parksmap-1   2         2         0         4h
----

You can see that we now have 2 replicas. Let's verify the number of pods with
the `oc get pods` command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pods

NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-1-8g6lb   1/1       Running   0          1m
parksmap-1-hx0kv   1/1       Running   0          4h
----

And lastly, let's verify that the *Service* that we learned about in the
previous lab accurately reflects two endpoints:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc describe svc parksmap
----

You will see something like the following output:

[source,bash]
----
Name:			parksmap
Namespace:		userXY
Labels:			app=parksmap
Selector:		deploymentconfig=parksmap
Type:			ClusterIP
IP:			172.30.169.213
Port:			8080-tcp	8080/TCP
Endpoints:		10.1.0.5:8080,10.1.1.5:8080
Session Affinity:	None
No events.
----

Another way to look at a *Service*'s endpoints is with the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get endpoints parksmap
----

And you will see something like the following:

[source,bash]
----
NAME       ENDPOINTS                                   AGE
parksmap   10.1.0.5:8080,10.1.1.5:8080                 4h
----

Your IP addresses will likely be different, as each pod receives a unique IP
within the OpenShift environment. The endpoint list is a quick way to see how
many pods are behind a service.

You can also see that both *Pods* are running using the web console:

image::parksmap-scaled.png[Scaling]

Overall, that's how simple it is to scale an application (*Pods* in a
*Service*). Application scaling can happen extremely quickly because OpenShift
is just launching new instances of an existing image, especially if that image
is already cached on the node.

### Application "Self Healing"

Because OpenShift's *RCs* are constantly monitoring to see that the desired number
of *Pods* actually is running, you might also expect that OpenShift will "fix" the
situation if it is ever not right. You would be correct!

Since we have two *Pods* running right now, let's see what happens if we
"accidentally" kill one. Run the `oc get pods` command again, and choose a *Pod*
name. Then, do the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete pod parksmap-1-hx0kv && oc get pods

pod "parksmap-1-h45hj" deleted
NAME               READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-1-h45hj   1/1       Terminating         0          4m
parksmap-1-q4b4r   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          1s
parksmap-1-vdkd9   1/1       Running             0          32s
----

Did you notice anything? There is a container being terminated (the one we deleted),
and there's a new container already being created.

Also, the names of the *Pods* are slightly changed.
That's because OpenShift almost immediately detected that the current state (1
*Pod*) didn't match the desired state (2 *Pods*), and it fixed it by scheduling
another *Pod*.

Additionally, OpenShift provides rudimentary capabilities around checking the
liveness and/or readiness of application instances. If the basic checks are
insufficient, OpenShift also allows you to run a command inside the container in
order to perform the check. That command could be a complicated script that uses
any installed language.

Based on these health checks, if OpenShift decided that our `parksmap`
application instance wasn't alive, it would kill the instance and then restart
it, always ensuring that the desired number of replicas was in place.

More information on probing applications is available in the
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/dev_guide/application_health.html[Application
Health] section of the documentation and later in this guide.

### Exercise: Scale Down

Before we continue, go ahead and scale your application down to a single
instance. Feel free to do this using whatever method you like.

WARNING: Don't forget to scale down back to 1 instance your `parksmap` component as otherwise you might experience some weird behavior in later labs. This is due to how the application has been coded and not to OpenShift itself.
