## Lab: Deploying Java Code

### Application Description
In this lab, we're going to deploy a backend service, developed in Java
programming language that will expose 2 main REST endpoints to the visualizer
application (`parksmap` web component that was deployed in the previous labs).
The application will query for national parks information (including it's
coordinates) that is stored in a Mongo database.  This application will also
provide an external access point, so that the API provided can be directly used
by the end user.

### Background: Source-to-Image (S2I)

In a previous lab, we learned how to deploy a pre-existing Docker-formatted
image. Now we will expand on that a bit by learning how OpenShift builds a
Docker images using source code from an existing repository.

https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is another
open source project sponsored by Red Hat. Its goal:

[source]
----
Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible Docker images. S2I
produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a Docker image and
assembling a new Docker image which incorporates the builder image and built
source. The result is then ready to use with docker run. S2I supports
incremental builds which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously
built artifacts, etc.
----

OpenShift is S2I-enabled and can use S2I as one of its build mechanisms (in
addition to building Docker images from Dockerfiles, and "custom" builds).

OpenShift runs the S2I process inside a special *Pod*, called a Build
Pod, and thus builds are subject to quotas, limits, resource scheduling, and
other aspects of OpenShift.

A full discussion of S2I is beyond the scope of this class, but you can find
more information about it either in the
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/latest/creating_images/s2i.html[OpenShift S2I documentation]
or on GitHub (following the link above). The only key concept you need to
remember about S2I is that it's magic.

### Exercise: Creating a Java application

The backend service that we will be deploying as part of this exercise is
called `nationalparks`.  This is a Java Spring Boot application that performs 2D
geo-spatial queries against a MongoDB database to locate and return map
coordinates of all National Parks in the world. That was just a fancy way of
saying that we are going to deploy a webservice that returns a JSON list of
places.

#### Add to Project
Because the `nationalparks` application is a back-end to serve data that our
existing front-end will consume, we are going to build it inside the existing
`{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` project. And, we will do it from the web console.

#### Using application code on embedded GitLab

OpenShift can work with any accessible Git repository. This could be GitHub,
GitLab, or any other server that speaks Git. You can even register webhooks in
your Git server to initiate OpenShift builds triggered by any update to the
application code!

The repository that we are going to use is already cloned in the internal GitLab repository
and located at the following URL:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks/tree/{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}}
----

[NOTE]
====
Your GitLab credentials are: *{{GITLAB_USER}}/{{GITLAB_PASSWORD}}*
====

Later in the lab, we want you to make a code change and then rebuild your
application. This is a fairly simple Spring framework Java application.

#### Build the Code on OpenShift

Similar to how we used "Add to project" before with a Docker-formatted image, we
can do the same for specifying a source code repository. Since for this lab you
have your own GitLab repository, let's use it with a simple Java S2I image.

In the OpenShift web console, find your `{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` project, and then
click the *"Add to Project"* button. You will see a list of categories of
runtimes, and other types of components that you can deploy and run on OpenShift.

Type _"jdk"_ into the search box, and then select the item titled
`redhat-openjdk18-openshift`.

image::ocp-runtimes.png[Runtimes]

After you click `redhat-openjdk18-openshift`, on the next screen you will need
to enter a name and a Git repository URL. For the name, enter `nationalparks`,
and for the Git repository URL, enter:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks.git
----

NOTE: All of these runtimes shown are made available via *Templates* and
*ImageStreams*, which will be discussed in a later lab.

image::new-national-parks-1.png[Runtimes]

These labs were written against specific points in time for these
applications. With Git as our version control system (VCS), we are using the
concept of *Branches/Tags*. Click on *Show advanced routing, build, and deployment
options*. In the *Git Reference* field enter "*{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}}*". This will cause the S2I
process to grab that specific tag in the code repository.

image::nationalparks-tag.png[Runtimes]

{% if USE_MAVEN %}

To speed build process, a Sonatype Nexus server is running in the environment
that will cache your dependencies as you pull them down. To use it, you need to
scroll down to *Build Configuration* and add an environment variable named
*MAVEN_MIRROR_URL* with value
`http://nexus.workshop-infra.svc.cluster.local:8081/content/groups/public`

image::new-national-parks-2.png[Runtimes]
{% endif %}

You can then hit the button labeled *"Create"*. Then click *Continue to
overview*. You will see this in the web console:

[source]
----
Build nationalparks, #1 Running. A new deployment will be created automatically
once the build completes.  a few seconds ago View Log
----

Go ahead and click *"View Log"*. This is a Java-based application that uses
Maven as the build and dependency system.  For this reason, the initial build
will take a few minutes as Maven downloads all of the dependencies needed for
the application. You can see all of this happening in real time!

From the command line, you can also see the *Builds*:

[source]
----
$ oc get builds
----

You'll see output like:

[source]
----
NAME              TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED              DURATION
nationalparks-1   Source    Git@b052ae6   Running    About a minute ago   1m2s
----

You can also view the build logs with the following command:

[source]
----
$ oc logs -f builds/nationalparks-1
----

After the build has completed and successfully:

* The S2I process will push the resulting Docker-formatted image to the internal OpenShift registry
* The *DeploymentConfiguration* (DC) will detect that the image has changed, and this
  will cause a new deployment to happen.
* A *ReplicationController* (RC) will be spawned for this new deployment.
* The RC will detect no *Pods* are running and will cause one to be deployed, as our default replica count is just 1.

In the end, when issuing the `oc get pods` command, you will see that the build Pod
has finished (exited) and that an application *Pod* is in a ready and running state:

[source]
----
NAME                    READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nationalparks-1-tkid3   1/1       Running     3          2m
nationalparks-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          3m
parksmap-1-4hbtk        1/1       Running     0          2h
----

If you look again at the web console, you will notice that, when you create the
application this way, OpenShift also creates a *Route* for you. You can see the
URL in the web console, or via the command line:

[source]
----
$ oc get routes
----

Where you should see something like the following:

[source]
----
NAME            HOST/PORT                                                   PATH      SERVICES        PORT       TERMINATION
nationalparks   nationalparks-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}             nationalparks   8080-tcp
parksmap        parksmap-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}                  parksmap        8080-tcp
----

In the above example, the URL is:

[source]
----
http://nationalparks-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}
----

Since this is a back-end application, it doesn't actually have a web interface.
However, it can still be used with a browser. All back ends that work with the parks map
front end are required to implement a `/ws/info/` endpoint. To test, the
complete URL to enter in your browser is:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
http://nationalparks-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/info/
----

WARNING: The trailing slash is *required*.

You will see a simple JSON string:

[source]
----
{"id":"nationalparks","displayName":"National Parks","center":{"latitude":"47.039304","longitude":"14.505178"},"zoom":4}
----

Earlier we said:

[source]
----
This is a Java Spring Boot application that performs 2D geo-spatial queries
against a MongoDB database
----

But we don't have a database. Yet.
