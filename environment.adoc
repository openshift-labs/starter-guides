## Environment Overview

image::ocp-architecture.png[OCP Architecture]

You will be interacting with an OpenShift environment that is running on {{ ENVIRONMENT }}. The environment consists of the following systems:

* {{ MASTERS }} master nodes
* {{ INFRA }} infrastructure nodes
* {{ NODES }} "application" nodes
{% if NFS_ENABLED %}
* An NFS server
{% endif %}

The infrastructure node is providing several services:

{% if LOGGING_ENABLED %}
* Aggregated logging
{% endif %}
{% if METRICS_ENABLED %}
* Cluster metrics
{% endif %}
* {{GIT_SERVER}} git server
* This lab manual
* The OpenShift Docker registry
* The OpenShift router
{% if ETHERPAD_ENABLED %}
* Etherpad
{% endif %}

Additionally, {{ NUM_USERS }} user accounts have been provisioned.

{% if ETHERPAD_ENABLED %}
Before continuing, please visit visit the Etherpad at the following URL:

----
http://{{ ETHERPAD_URL_PREFIX }}.{{ ROUTER_ADDRESS }}/p/workshop
----

Decide on a user account, between user01 and user{{ NUM_USERS }}, or use the one that
has been assigned to you by the instructor. Type that user
account and your name next to it. This will be your user account for the
duration of these exercises. For example:

----
userxx=Luke Skywalker
----

If you already see a name next to a user account, it means that someone else has
already claimed it.
{% endif %}


You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises. Some of
the command blocks can be copy/pasted directly. Others will require
modification of the command before execution. If you see a command block with a
red border (see below), the command will require modification. Typically this is
a substitution of your username or user number:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
some command for userXX
----
