You will be interacting with an OpenShift environment that is running on a 
public cloud. The environment consists of the following systems:

* {{ ENV_MASTERS }} master node(s)
* {{ ENV_INFRA }} infrastructure node(s)
* {{ ENV_NODES }} "application" nodes
* An NFS server

The infrastructure node is providing several services:

* Gogs git server
* This lab manual
* The OpenShift Docker registry
* The OpenShift router
* Etherpad

Additionally, a predefined number of user accounts have been provisioned.

Before continuing, please visit visit the Etherpad at the following URL:

----
http://etherpad-{{ INFRA_PROJECT }}.{{ ROUTER_ADDRESS }}/p/workshop
----

Decide on a user account among one of the available users or use 
the one that has been assigned to you by the instructor. Find that user
account and type your name next to it. This will be your user account for the
duration of these exercises. For example:

----
{{ USER_NAME }}=Luke Skywalker
----

If you already see a name next to a user account, it means that someone 
else has already claimed it.

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises. 
Some of the command blocks can be copy/pasted directly. Others will require 
modification of the command before execution. If you see a command block with 
a red border (see below), the command will require modification. Typically 
this is a substitution of your username or user number:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
some command for {{ USER_NAME }}
----
