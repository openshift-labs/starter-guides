## Lab: Adding a Database

### Application Description
In this lab, we're going to deploy a Mongo database that will be used to store the data for the `nationalparks` application. We will also connect the `nationalparks` service with the newly deployed Mongo database, so that the `nationalparks` service can load and query the database for the corresponding information.

Finally, we will mark the `nationalparks` application as a backend for the map visualization tool, so that it can be dynamically discovered by the `parksmap` component using the OpenShift discovery mechanism and the map will be displayed automatically.

### Background: Storage
Most useful applications are "stateful" or "dynamic" in some way, and this is
usually achieved with a database or other data storage. In this next lab we are
going to add MongoDB to our `nationalparks` application and then rewire it to
talk to the database using environment variables.

We are going to use the MongoDB image that is included with OpenShift.

By default, this will use *EmptyDir* for data storage, which means if the *Pod*
disappears the data does as well. In a real application you would use
OpenShift's persistent storage mechanism to attach real-world storage (NFS,
Gluster, EBS, etc) to the *Pods* to give them a persistent place to store their
data.

### Background: Environment Variables

As you've seen so far, the web console makes it very easy to deploy things onto
OpenShift. When we deploy the database, we pass in some environment variables.
These environment variables are used to set the username, password, and name of
the database.  You can change the
values of these environment variables to anything you would like.  The variables
we are going to be setting are as follows:

- MONGODB_USER
- MONGODB_PASSWORD
- MONGODB_DATABASE
- MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD

The database image is built in a way that it will automatically configure itself
using the supplied information (assuming there is no data already present in the
persistent storage!). The image will ensure that:

- A database exists with the specified name
- A user exists with the specified name
- The user can access the specified database with the specified password

In the web console in your `userXY` project, again click the *"Add to
Project"* button, and then find the `mongodb-ephemeral` template, and click it.
You will notice that there are several MongoDB templates available, some of
which come with application servers pre-configured. We just need a database,
though, so `mongodb-ephemeral` is what you should choose.

When we performed the application build we selected the
builder image to use and OpenShift presented us the standard build workflow.
Now we are using a template, a preconfigured set of resources that includes
parameters that can be customized. In our case, the parameters we are concerned
with are the environment variables discussed before (user, password, database, and
admin password).

You can see that some of the fields say *"generated if empty"*. This is a
feature of *Templates* in OpenShift that will be covered in the next lab. For
now, be sure to use the following values in their respective fields:

* `MongoDB Connection Username` : *`mongodb`*
* `MongoDB Connection Password` : *`mongodb`*
* `MongoDB Database Name`: *`mongodb`* (*NOTE:* Default value of `simpledb` needs to be changed)
* `MongoDB Admin Password` : *`mongodb`*

You can leave the rest of the values as their defaults, and then click
*"Create"*. Then click *Continue to overview*. The MongoDB instance should
quickly be deployed.

#### Exercise: Wiring the Application and the Database

When we initially created the `nationalparks` application, we provided no environment
variables. The application is looking for a database, but can't find one, and it
fails gracefully (you don't see an error).

We need to configure the `nationalparks` *Pod*(s) to have the right values in
the right environment variables so that the application knows how and where to
find MongoDB.

If you think way back to the beginning of the labs, you will recall that a
*DeploymentConfiguration* tells OpenShift how to deploy something. This includes
things like what environment variables to configure. So, to set up the right
environment variables, we simply need to modify the *DeploymentConfiguration*
(DC). This can easily be done from either the web interface or via the command
line.

The command line takes a little less time, so let's use that option. First, find
the name of the DC:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get dc
----

Then, use the `oc env` command to set environment variables directly on the DC:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc env dc nationalparks -e DB_USERNAME=mongodb -e DB_PASSWORD=mongodb -e DB_NAME=mongodb -e DB_HOST=mongodb
----

NOTE: Note that environment variables in this application are named different than in the database.

After you have modified the *DeploymentConfig* object, you can verify the
environment variables have been added by viewing the YAML for it:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get dc nationalparks -o yaml
----

You should see the following section:

[source,yaml]
----
- env:
  - name: DB_USERNAME
    value: mongodb
  - name: DB_PASSWORD
    value: mongodb
  - name: DB_NAME
    value: mongodb
  - name: DB_HOST
    value: mongodb
----

You can also just ask OpenShift to tell you about the environment variables on
the DC:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc env dc/nationalparks --list
# deploymentconfigs nationalparks, container nationalparks
DB_USER=mongodb
DB_PASSWORD=mongodb
DB_NAME=mongodb
DB_HOST=mongodb
----

#### Exercise: Exploring OpenShift Magic
As soon as we set the environment variables on the *DeploymentConfiguration*, some
magic happened. OpenShift decided that this was a significant enough change to
warrant updating the internal version number of the *DeploymentConfiguration*. You
can verify this by looking at the output of `oc get dc`:

[source,bash]
----
NAME            REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
mongodb         1          1         1         config,image(mongodb:3.2)
nationalparks   2          1         1         config,image(nationalparks:{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}})
parksmap        1          1         1         config,image(parksmap:{{PARKSMAP_VERSION}})
----

Something that increments the version of a *DeploymentConfiguration*, by default,
causes a new deployment. You can verify this by looking at the output of `oc get
rc`:

[source,bash]
----
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
mongodb-1         1         1         0         24m
nationalparks-1   0         0         0         3h
nationalparks-2   1         1         0         8m
parksmap-1        1         1         0         6h
----

We see that the desired and current number of instances for the "-1" deployment
is 0. The desired and current number of instances for the "-2" deployment is 1.
This means that OpenShift has gracefully torn down our "old" application and
stood up a "new" instance.

#### Exercise: Data, Data, Everywhere

Now that we have a database deployed, we can again visit the `nationalparks` web
service to query for data:

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `userXY` with the project provided to you.

[source,bash]
----
http://nationalparks-userXY.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/data/all
----

And the result?

[source,bash]
----
[]
----

Where's the data? Think about the process you went through. You deployed the
application and then deployed the database. Nothing actually loaded anything
*INTO* the database, though.

The application provides an endpoint to do just that:

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `userXY` with the project provided to you.

[source,bash]
----
http://nationalparks-userXY.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/data/load
----

And the result?

[source,bash]
----
Items inserted in database: 2740
----

If you then go back to `/ws/data/all` you will see tons of JSON data now.
That's great. Our parks map should finally work!

NOTE: There's some errors reported with browsers like firefox 54 that don't properly parse the resulting JSON. It's
a browser problem, and the application is working properly.

[NOTE]
====
You are probably wondering how the database connection magically started
working? When deploying applications to OpenShift, it is always best to use
environment variables to define connections to dependent systems.  This allows
for application portability across different environments.  The source file that
performs the connection as well as creates the database schema can be viewed
here:

{% if GIT_HOST != "github" %}
CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `{{GITLAB_USER}}` with the Git username provided to you.
{% endif %}

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
{% if PARKSMAP_PY %}
{% if GIT_HOST == "github" %}
https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/nationalparks-py/blob/master/wsgi.py#L11-L18
{% else %}
http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks-py/blob/{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}}/wsgi.py#L11-18
{% endif %}
{% else %}
http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks/blob/{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}}/src/main/java/org/openshift/parks/mongo/DBConnection.java#L44-l48
{% endif %}
----

In short summary: By referring to environment variables to connect to services
(like databases), it can be trivial to promote applications throughout different
lifecycle environments on OpenShift without having to modify application code.

You can learn more about environment variables in the
https://docs.openshift.org/dev_guide/environment_variables.html[environment
variables] section of the Developer Guide.

----

Hmm... There's just one thing. The main map **STILL** isn't displaying the parks.
That's because the front end parks map only tries to talk to services that have
the right *Label*.

#### Exercise: Working With Labels

We explored how a *Label* is just a key=value pair earlier when looking at
*Services* and *Routes* and *Selectors*. In general, a *Label* is simply an
arbitrary key=value pair. It could be anything.

* `pizza=pepperoni`
* `wicked=googly`
* `openshift=awesome`

In the case of the parks map, the application is actually querying the OpenShift
API and asking about the *Routes* in the project. If any of them have a
*Label* that is `type=parksmap-backend`, the application knows to interrogate
that service's endpoints to look for map data.
{% if PARKSMAP_PY %}
You can see the code that does this link:https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/parksmap-web-py/blob/1.0.0/app.py#L85[here].
{% else %}
You can see the code that does this link:https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/parksmap-web/blob/1.0.0/src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/rest/ServiceWatcher.java#L20[here].
{% endif %}

Fortunately, the command line provides a convenient way for us to manipulate
labels. `describe` the `nationalparks` service:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc describe route nationalparks

Name:                   nationalparks
Namespace:              userXY
Created:                2 hours ago
Labels:                 app=nationalparks
Requested Host:         nationalparks-userXY.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}
                        exposed on router router 2 hours ago
Path:                   <none>
TLS Termination:        <none>
Insecure Policy:        <none>
Endpoint Port:          8080-tcp

Service:                nationalparks
Weight:                 100 (100%)
Endpoints:              10.1.9.8:8080
----

You see that it only has one label: `app=nationalparks`. Now, use `oc label`:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc label route nationalparks type=parksmap-backend
----

You will see something like:

[source,bash]
----
route "nationalparks" labeled
----

If you check your browser now:

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `userXY` with the project provided to you.

[source,bash]
----
http://parksmap-userXY.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/
----

image::parksmap-new-parks.png[MongoDB]

You'll notice that the parks suddenly are showing up. That's really cool!
