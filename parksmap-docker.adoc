## Lab: Deploy a Docker Image

### Application description
In this lab, we're going to deploy the web component of the ParksMap application which is also called `parksmap` and uses OpenShift service discovery mechanism to discover the backend services deployed and shows their data on the map.

### Exercise: Deploying your first Image

Let's start by doing the simplest thing possible - get a plain old
Docker-formatted image to run on OpenShift. This is incredibly simple to do.
With OpenShift it can be done directly from the web console.

Return to the web console:

*link:{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}[]*

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `userXY` with the project provided to you.

Find your *userXY* project and click it. Next,
click on the `Deploy Image` in the *"Add to Project"* drop down.  This will open a dialog that will allow you to specify the information for the image you want to deploy.

#TODO: Show image of this drop down.

There are several options, but we are only concerned with "Deploy Image". Click
it. We will learn more about image streams and image stream tags later. For now,
select the "Image Name" option, and copy/paste the following into the box:

[source]
----
docker.io/openshiftroadshow/{{PARKSMAP_IMAGENAME}}:{{PARKSMAP_VERSION}}
----

Your screen will end up looking something like this:

image::parksmap-image.png[Explore Project]

Either press *enter* or click on the magnifying glass. OpenShift will then go
out to the Docker registry specified and interrogate the image. You then are
presented with some options to add things like environment variables, labels,
and etc. -- which we will learn about later.

Make sure to have the correct application name:

image::parksmap-image-options.png[Explore Project]

Let's scroll to the bottom of this page and add some labels to better identify 
this deployment later. Labels will help us identify and filter components in the
web UI and in the command line.

We will add 3 labels:

- *__app__=workshop*  (the name we will be giving to the app)
- *__component__=parksmap*  (the name of this deployment)
- *__role__=frontend* (the role this component plays in the overall application)

image::parksmap-image-options-labels.png[Explore Project]

Hit the blue "Deploy" button at the bottom of the dialog and then click the
"Continue to overview" link or the "Close" button. Take a moment to look at the various messages that
you now see on the overview page.

WINNING! These few steps are the only ones you need to run to get a
Docker-formatted image deployed on OpenShift. This should work with any
Docker-formatted image that follows best practices, such as defining an EXPOSE
port, not needing to run specifically as the *root user* or other user name, and
a single non-exiting CMD to execute on start. 

NOTE: Providing appropriate labels is desired when deploying complex applications for organization purposes. OpenShift uses a label *app* to define and group components together in the Overview page. OpenShift will create this label with some default if the user don't provide it explicitly.

### Background: Containers and Pods

Before we start digging in, we need to understand how containers and *Pods* are
related. We will not be covering the background on these technologies in this lab but if you have questions please inform the instructor. Instead, we will dive right in and start using them.

In OpenShift, the smallest deployable unit is a *Pod*. A *Pod* is a group of one or more OCI containers deployed together and guaranteed to be on the same host.
From the official OpenShift documentation:

[quote]
__
Each pod has its own IP address, therefore owning its entire port space, and
containers within pods can share storage. Pods can be "tagged" with one or
more labels, which are then used to select and manage groups of pods in a
single operation.
__

*Pods* can contain multiple OCI containers. The general idea is for a Pod to
contain a "main process" and any auxiliary services you want to run along with that process. Examples of containers you might put in a *Pod* are, an Apache HTTPD
server, a log analyzer, and a file service to help manage uploaded files.

### Exercise: Examining the Pod

In the web console's overview page you will see that there is a single *Pod* that
was created by your actions. 

image::parksmap-overview.png[Pod overview]

You can also get a list of all the pods created within your project, by navigating to 
"Applications -> Pods"

image::parksmap-podlist.png[Pod list]

This *Pod* contains a single container, which
happens to be the `parksmap` application - a simple Spring Boot/Java application.

You can also examine *Pods* from the command line:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pod
----

You should see output that looks similar to:

[source,bash]
----
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-1-hx0kv   1/1       Running   0          2m
----

The above output lists all of the *Pods* in the current *Project*, including the
*Pod* name, state, restarts, and uptime. Once you have a *Pod*'s name, you can
get more information about the *Pod* using the *oc get* command.  To make the
output readable, I suggest changing the output type to *YAML* using the
following syntax:

NOTE: Make sure you use the correct *Pod* name from your output.

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
$ oc get pod parksmap-1-hx0kv -o yaml
----

You should see something like the following output (which has been truncated due
to space considerations of this workshop manual):

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/created-by: |

urceVersion":"36222"}}
    kubernetes.io/limit-ranger: 'LimitRanger plugin set: cpu, memory request for container
      parksmap; cpu, memory limit for container parksmap'

    openshift.io/deployment-config.name: parksmap
    openshift.io/deployment.name: parksmap-1

  labels:
    app: parksmap
    deployment: parksmap-1
    deploymentconfig: parksmap
  name: parksmap-1-bvaz6
...............
----

The web interface also shows a lot of the same information on the *Pod* details
page. If you click in the *Pod* circle, you will
find the details page. You can also get there by clicking "Applications", then
"Pods", at the left, and then clicking the *Pod* name.

image::parksmap-pod.png[Pod list]

Getting the parksmap image running may take a little while to complete. Each
OpenShift node that is asked to run the image has to pull (download) it, if the
node does not already have it cached locally. You can check on the status of the
image download and deployment in the *Pod* details page, or from the command
line with the `oc get pods` command that you used before.

### Background: Customizing the image lifecycle behavior

Whenever OpenShift asks the node's CRI (Container Runtime Interface) runtime (Docker daemon or CRI-O) to run an image, the runtime will check to make sure it has the right "version" of the image to run.
If it doesn't, it will pull it from the specified registry.

There are a number of ways to customize this behavior. They are documented in
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.html#specifying-an-image[specifying an image]
as well as
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/dev_guide/managing_images.html#image-pull-policy[image pullpolicy].

#### Background: Services

*Services* provide a convenient abstraction layer inside OpenShift to find a
group of similar *Pods*. They also act as an internal proxy/load balancer between
those *Pods* and anything else that needs to access them from inside the
OpenShift environment. For example, if you needed more parksmap instances to
handle the load, you could spin up more *Pods*. OpenShift automatically maps
them as endpoints to the *Service*, and the incoming requests would not notice
anything different except that the *Service* was now doing a better job handling
the requests.

When you asked OpenShift to run the image, it automatically created a *Service*
for you. Remember that services are an internal construct. They are not
available to the "outside world", or anything that is outside the OpenShift
environment. That's OK, as you will learn later.

The way that a *Service* maps to a set of *Pods* is via a system of *Labels* and
*Selectors*. *Services* are assigned a fixed IP address and many ports and
protocols can be mapped.

There is a lot more information about
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[Services],
including the YAML format to make one by hand, in the official documentation.

Now that we understand the basics of what a *Service* is, let's take a look at
the *Service* that was created for the image that we just deployed. In order to
view the *Services* defined in your *Project*, enter in the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get services
----

You should see output similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
NAME       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
parksmap   172.30.169.213   <none>        8080/TCP   3h
----

In the above output, we can see that we have a *Service* named `parksmap` with an
IP/Port combination of 172.30.169.213/8080TCP. Your IP address may be different, as
each *Service* receives a unique IP address upon creation. *Service* IPs are
fixed and never change for the life of the *Service*.

In the web console, service information is available by clicking "Applications"
and then clicking "Services".

image::parksmap-serviceslist.png[Services list]

You can also get more detailed information about a *Service* by using the
following command to display the data in YAML:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get service parksmap -o yaml
----

You should see output similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftWebConsole
  creationTimestamp: 2016-10-03T15:33:17Z
  labels:
    app: parksmap
  name: parksmap
  namespace: userXY
  resourceVersion: "6893"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/userXY/services/parksmap
  uid: b51260a9-897e-11e6-bdaa-2cc2602f8794
spec:
  clusterIP: 172.30.169.213
  ports:
  - name: 8080-tcp
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    deploymentconfig: parksmap
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
----

Take note of the `selector` stanza. Remember it.

Alternatively, you can use the web console to view information about the *Service*.

image::parksmap-service.png[Service]

It is also of interest to view the YAML of the *Pod* to understand how OpenShift
wires components together. For example, run the following command to get the
name of your `parksmap` *Pod*:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pods
----

You should see output similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-1-hx0kv   1/1       Running   0          3h
----

Now you can view the detailed data for your *Pod* with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pod parksmap-1-hx0kv -o yaml
----

Under the `metadata` section you should see the following:

[source,bash]
----
  labels:
    app: workshop
    component: parksmap
    deployment: parksmap-1
    deploymentconfig: parksmap
    role: frontend
----

* The *Service* has `selector` stanza that refers to `deploymentconfig=parksmap`.
* The *Pod* has multiple *Labels*:
** `app=workshop`
** `component=parksmap`
** `role=frontend`
** `deploymentconfig=parksmap`
** `deployment=parksmap-1`

*Labels* are just key/value pairs. Any *Pod* in this *Project* that has a *Label* that
matches the *Selector* will be associated with the *Service*. To see this in
action, issue the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc describe service parksmap
----

You should see something like the following output:

[source,bash]
----
Name:                   parksmap
Namespace:              userXY
Labels:                 app=workshop
                        component=parksmap
                        role=frontend
Selector:               deploymentconfig=parksmap
Type:                   ClusterIP
IP:                     172.30.169.213
Port:                   8080-tcp        8080/TCP
Endpoints:              10.1.2.5:8080
Session Affinity:       None
No events.
----

You may be wondering why only one endpoint is listed. That is because there is
only one *Pod* currently running.  In the next lab, we will learn how to scale
an application, at which point you will be able to see multiple endpoints
associated with the *Service*.
