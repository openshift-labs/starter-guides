### Explain the Demo Concepts

* Explain that security is one of the largest concerns around containers and how organizations 
need to gain visiliby into packages installed inside containers and make sure they don't container 
critical security issues.

* Explain that Red Hat CloudForms is a cloud managment solution that is included with OpenShift Container Platform 
free of charge for managing OpenShift environments and it can itself run as a container deployed on OpenShift.

### Demonstrate the OpenShift Overview

* Go to *CloudForms* dashbaord and log in with the following credentials:
** CloudForms: {{CLOUDFORMS_URL}}
** Username: _{{CLOUDFORMS_USER}}_
** Password: _{{CLOUDFORMS_PASSWORD}}_

* Explain that Red Hat CloudForms can manage any type of infrastructure such as OpenStack, Public Clouds (e.g. Amazon Web Service), 
Virtualization and more but in this demo you will focus on container management capabilities.

* On the left sidebar menu, go to *Compute -> Containers -> Overview*

* Explain the overview of resoures available in the OpenShift provider managed by CloudForms including nodes, 
projects, container images, etc

* Explain the memory, cpu and network graphes and utilization trends in order to do capability planning (right-sizing)

* Explain that alerts can be defined in order to perform actions when utilization or metrics move outside acceptable ranges

* Click on *Projects*

* Explain that user would see an overview of projects that he has access to with details such as number of pods, containers, images, etc

* Click on *coolstore-prod-{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}* project to go to *CoolStore PROD* environments

* Explain that the overview of *coolstore-prod-{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}* is displayed with details on the number of objects existing in this project

* Explain that you want to review the images built in production and check their Compliance

* Click on *Container Images*

* Click on *coolstore-prod-{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}/web-ui* container image

* Explain the metadata details of the image

* Explain that the green check shows that the image is scanned against the policies defined in CloudForms 
and it is compliant. The default policies are Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 OpenScap rules which can be customized by 
the admins running the platform. Explain that SCAP is a standardized compliance checking solution for
enterprise-level Linux infrastructure and it contains a set of specifications for maintaining system security for enterprise systems.

* Explain that as soon as an image is pushed to OpenShift image registry, a scan is scheduled and if 
the scan marks the image non-compliant, CloudForms ensures security by rejecting the 
image by default and preventing it from being deployed on OpenShift.

* Explain that you can also get the list of all the OpenScap rules that are checked against 
the container image and also download them as an HTML report.

* Click on *OpenScap HTML* to download the report and open it in the browser

* Explain that the list of rules and their status is listed in the report in addition to the details of each rule 
and the CVEs related to it

* Go back to CloudForms dashboard

* Click on *Packages* 

* Explain that the list of packages inslides inside the container image in addition to the version and description is displayed

* Click on browsers back button to go back to the *coolstore-prod-{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}/web-ui* container image

* Explain that when a container image is available in the registry, other teams might 
deploy that in their environments in order to perform tests or else and therefore there 
is a need to find out where an image is deployed.

* Click on *Relationships* in the middle menu

* Explain that a list of relevant objects such as in which projects, pods, containers 
and nodes the *coolstore-prod-{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}/web-ui* is deployed

* Click on *Pods (2)*

* Explain the the image is deployed into 2 pods, one in the *CoolStore TEST* environment 
and other in *CoolStore PROD*
