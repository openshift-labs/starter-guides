## Lab: Making Code Changes and using webhooks

### Background: Web Hooks

Most Git repository servers support the concept of web hooks -- calling to an
external source via HTTP(S) when a change in the code repository happens.
OpenShift provides an API endpoint that supports receiving hooks from
remote systems in order to trigger builds. By pointing the code repository's
hook at the OpenShift API, automated code/build/deploy pipelines can be
achieved.

#### Exercise: Configuring Gogs Web Hooks

{% if modules.pipelines %}
In previous labs, you created a CI/CD Pipeline to automate build, test and deployment of
the `nationalparks` application. In this lab you can use the pipline webhook to
trigger a pipeline execution every time there is a change in the `nationalparks` Gogs
repository. In the OpenShift web console, navigate to your `{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` *Project*, and
then mouse-over *Builds* and then *Pipelines*. Click the `nationalparks-pipeline` and
then *Configuration* tab.

On this screen you will see the option to copy the *generic* webhook URL as shown
in the following image:

image::ocp-webhook1-pipeline.png[Webhook]
{% else %}
In the OpenShift web console, navigate to your `{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` *Project*, and
then mouse-over *Browse* and then *Builds*. Click the `nationalparks` build.

On this screen you will see the option to copy the *generic* webhook URL as shown
in the following image:

image::ocp-webhook1.png[Webhook]
{% endif %}


Once you have the URL copied to your clipboard, navigate to the code repository
that you have on your local Gogs:

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `{{GITLAB_USER}}` with the Git username provided to you.

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
{% if PARKSMAP_PY %}
http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks-py/tree/{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}}
{% else %}
http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks
{% endif %}
----

[NOTE]
====
The credentials for this Gogs instance are:

Username: {{GITLAB_USER}}

Password: {{GITLAB_PASSWORD}}
====

Click the Settings link on the top right of the screen:

image::gogs-ocp-webhook2.png[Webhook]

Click on webhooks, and the on `Add Webhook` button.

image::gogs-ocp-webhook3.png[Webhook]

In the next screen, paste your link into the "URL" field. You can leave the
secret token field blank -- the secret is already in the URL and does not need
to be in the payload, or copy it from the URL.

Change the `Content Type` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

Finally, click on "Add webhook".

image::gogs-ocp-webhook4.png[Webhook]

Boom! From now on, every time you commit new source code to your Gogs
repository, a new build and deploy will occur inside of OpenShift.  Let's try
this out.

#### Exercise: Using Gogs Web Hooks

{% if PARKSMAP_PY %}
Be sure you return to the proper tag in the git repository:

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `{{GITLAB_USER}}` with the Git username provided to you.

*link:http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks-py/tree/{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}}[]*

Click "Project" at the top of the Gogs page, and then "Files" towards the
middle of the page. This is Gogs's repository view. Make sure that the
drop-down menu at the upper right is set for the `1.0.0` branch. Navigate to the
root path and click on the `wsgi.py` file.

Once you have the file on the screen, click the edit button in the top right
hand corner as shown here:

image::ocp-webhook5-py.png[Webhook]

Change line number 35:

[source,python]
----
'displayName': 'National Parks (PY)'
----

To

[source,python]
----
'displayName': 'World National Parks (PY)'
----

{% else %}

Click "Project" at the top of the Gogs page, and then "Files" towards the
middle of the page. This is Gogs's repository view. Make sure that the
drop-down menu at the upper right is set for the `{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}}` branch. Navigate to the
following path:

[source,bash]
----
src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/parks/rest/
----

Then click on the `BackendController.java` file.

Once you have the file on the screen, click the edit button in the top right
hand corner as shown here:

image::gogs-ocp-webhook5.png[Webhook]

Change line number 20:

[source,java]
----
return new Backend("nationalparks","National Parks", new Coordinates("47.039304", "14.505178"), 4);
----

To

[source,java]
----
return new Backend("nationalparks","OpenShift National Parks", new Coordinates("47.039304", "14.505178"), 4);
----

{% endif %}

Click on Commit changes at the bottom of the screen. Feel free to enter a commit
message.


{% if modules.pipelines %}

Once you have committed your changes, the `nationalparks-pipeline` should almost
instantaneously be triggered in OpenShift. Look at the *Builds* &rarr; *Pipelines*
page in OpenShift Console to verify the pipeline is running:

image::ocp-webhook6-pipeline.png[Pipeline Running]

After the test stage, pipeline waits for manual approval in order to deploy to the
*Live* container. Click on *Input Required* link which takes you to the Jenkins Console
for approving the deployment and then *Proceed* button.

image::pipeline-jenkins-input.png[Pipline Manual Approval,1000,align=center]

Once the pipeline execution is finished, verify your new Docker image was
automatically deployed by viewing the application in your browser:

{% else %}
Once you have committed your changes, a *Build* should almost instantaneously be
triggered in OpenShift. Look at the *Builds* page in the web console, or run the
following command to verify:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get builds
----

You should see that a new build is running:

[source,bash]
----
NAME              TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED          DURATION
nationalparks-1   Source    Git@b052ae6   Complete   18 hours ago     36s
nationalparks-2   Source    Git@3b26e1a   Running    43 seconds ago
----

Once the build and deploy has finished, verify your new Docker image was
automatically deployed by viewing the application in your browser:
{% endif %}

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` with the project provided to you.

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
http://nationalparks{% if modules.pipelines %}-live{% endif %}-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/info/
----

You should now see the new name you have set in the JSON string returned.

NOTE: To see this in the map's legend itself, you will need to scale down your parksmap to 0, then back up to 1 to force the app to refresh its cache.


#### Exercise: Rollback

OpenShift allows you to move between different versions of an application
without the need to rebuild each time. Every version (past builds) of the
application exists as a Docker-formatted image in the OpenShift registry. Using
the `oc rollback` and `oc deploy` commands you can move back- or forward between
various versions of applications.

In order to perform a rollback, you need to know the name of the *Deployment Config*
which has deployed the application:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get dc
----

The output will be similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
NAME                 REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
mongodb              1          1         1         config,image(mongodb:3.2)
parksmap             2          1         1         config,image(parksmap:{{PARKSMAP_VERSION}})
nationalparks        9          1         1         {% if modules.pipelines %}config{% else %}config,image(nationalparks:latest){% endif %}
{% if modules.pipelines %}
jenkins              1          1         1         config,image(jenkins:latest)
mongodb-live         1          1         1         config,image(mongodb:3.2)
nationalparks-live   4          1         1         config,image(nationalparks:live)
{% endif %}
----
Now run the following command to rollback the latest code change:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc rollback nationalparks{% if modules.pipelines %}-live{% endif %}
----

You will see output like the following:

[source,bash]
----
#5 rolled back to nationalparks{% if modules.pipelines %}-live{% endif %}-3
Warning: the following images triggers were disabled: nationalparks:live
  You can re-enable them with: oc set triggers dc/nationalparks{% if modules.pipelines %}-live{% endif %} --auto
----

Once the deploy is complete, verify that the page header is reverted to the
original header by viewing the application in your browser.

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` with the project provided to you.

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
http://nationalparks{% if modules.pipelines %}-live{% endif %}-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/info/
----

[NOTE]
====
Automatic deployment of new images is disabled as part of the rollback
to prevent unwanted deployments soon after the rollback is complete. To re-enable
the automatic deployments run this:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc set triggers dc/nationalparks{% if modules.pipelines %}-live{% endif %} --auto
----
====

#### Exercise: Rollforward

Just like you performed a rollback, you can also perform a roll-forward using
the same command. You'll notice above that when you requested a *rollback*, it
caused a new deployment (#3). In essence, we always move forwards in OpenShift,
even if we are going "back".

{% if modules.pipelines %}
* We know that the first deployment (#1) was the initial definition.
* We know that the second deployment (#2) was due to our configmap addition.
* We know that the third deployment (#3) was our first run of the pipeline.
* We know that the fourth deployment (#4) was our change to "OpenShift National
  Parks".
* We know that the fifth deployment (#5) was our rollback to "National Parks".
{% endif %}

So, if we want to return to the "new code" version, that is deployment #4.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc rollback nationalparks{% if modules.pipelines %}-live{% endif %}-4
----

And you will see the following:
[source,bash]
----
#6 rolled back to nationalparks{% if modules.pipelines %}-live{% endif %}-4
Warning: the following images triggers were disabled: nationalparks:live
  You can re-enable them with: oc set triggers dc/nationalparks{% if modules.pipelines %}-live{% endif %} --auto
----

Cool! Once the *rollback* is complete, verify you again see "OpenShift
National Parks".
