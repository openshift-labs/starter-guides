# Getting Started on OpenShift for Developers - Guides

## Using this content

The content is updated and tracked in version branches. Version branch contains product name and version, e.g.

```
ocp-3.10
```

which is the current (at the time of writing) version. If you need to make sure to always us specific version,
switch to the correct branch and follow the steps there.

If you want to always use the latest stable version of the content, use the workshop definition from the `master`
branch which ensures that once new version of the content is released into the version branch, e.g. `ocp-3.11`
(at the time of writing), the definition will be updated and you will get the latest content.

If you are not sure what to do, switch to the latest version and follow from there.
