## Lab: Exploring OpenShift's Logging Capabilities

OpenShift provides some convenient mechanisms for viewing application logs.
First and foremost is the ability to examine a *Pod*'s logs directly from the
web console or via the command line.

### Background: Container Logs

OpenShift is constructed in such a way that it expects containers to log all
information to `STDOUT`. In this way, both regular and error information is
captured via standardized Docker mechanisms. When exploring the *Pod*'s logs
directly, you are essentially going through the Docker daemon to access the
container's logs, through OpenShift's API. Neat!

[NOTE]
====
In some cases, applications may not have been designed to send all of their
information to `STDOUT` and `STDERR`. In many cases, multiple local log files
are used. While OpenShift cannot parse any information from these files, nothing
prevents them from being created, either. In other cases, log information is
sent to some external system using. Here, too, OpenShift does not prohibit these
behaviors. If you have an application that does not log to `STDOUT`, either because it
already sends log information to some "external" system or because it writes
various log information to various files, fear not.

#### Exercise: Examining Logs

Since we already deployed our application, we can take some time to examine its
logs. In the web console, find your way back to the *Pod* details page
(Applications -> Pods -> specific pod) and then click on the "Logs" tab. You
should see a nice view of the *Pod*'s logs:

It appears there are some errors in the log, and that's OK. We'll remedy those
in a little bit.

You also have the option of viewing logs from the command line. Get the name of
your *Pod*:

[source]
----
$ oc get pods
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-1-hx0kv   1/1       Running   0          5h
----

And then use the `logs` command to view this *Pod*'s logs:

[source]
----
$ oc logs parksmap-1-hx0kv
----

You will see all of the application logs scroll on your screen:

[source]
----

15:34:25.937 [main] DEBUG io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.Config - Did not find Kubernetes config at: [/.kube/config]. Ignoring.

#### Exercise: Aggregated Pod Logs

When your application consists of only one *Pod* and it never fails, restarts,
or has other issues, these ways to view logs may not be so bad. However in a
scaled-out application where *Pods* may have restarted, been scaled up or down,
or if you just want to get historical information, these mechanisms may be
insufficient.

Fortunately, OpenShift provides an optional system for log aggregation that uses
Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (EFK).

In the OpenShift web console on the *Pod*'s logs page, at the right you will see
a "View Archive" link. Go ahead and click it. You will need to accept the SSL
certificate.

Clicking this link takes you to the Kibana web interface. This interface is
secured with OpenShift's role-based access controls, so you can only see logs
for projects that you have access to.

The "View Archive" link that you clicked takes you to a default view with a specific search term
pre-populated. Kibana will only show you logs where the pod name is
`parksmap-1-hx0kv` and in the *Project* (namespace) {{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.

[source]
----
kubernetes.pod_name:"parksmap-1-hx0kv" AND kubernetes.namespace_name:"{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}"
----

If you want to see all the historical logs for this *Project*, simply remove the
pod name reference and click the magnifying glass.

[source,role=copypaste]
----
kubernetes.namespace_name:"{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}"
----

If you click the "x" in the column for the container name, and, in the left bar,
click "add" for `kubernetes.pod_name`, you'll then see your old *Pod*'s logs,
too. Remember, we scaled them down before coming here, so you can see how the
log system is keeping a historical record.

Try the following search string:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
kubernetes.namespace_name:"{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}" AND message:"Failure executing"
----

Service account? What's that?
