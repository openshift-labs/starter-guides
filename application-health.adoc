## Lab: Application Health

### Background: Readiness and Liveness Probes
As we have seen before in the UI via warnings, there is a concept of application
health checks in OpenShift. These come in two flavors:

* Readiness probe
* Liveness probe

From the
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/dev_guide/application_health.html[Application
Health] section of the documentation, we see the definitions:

[glossary]
Liveness Probe::
  A liveness probe checks if the container in which it is configured is still
  running. If the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, which
  will be subjected to its restart policy. Set a liveness check by configuring
  the `template.spec.containers.livenessprobe` stanza of a pod configuration.
Readiness Probe::
  A readiness probe determines if a container is ready to service requests. If
  the readiness probe fails a container, the endpoints controller ensures the
  container has its IP address removed from the endpoints of all services. A
  readiness probe can be used to signal to the endpoints controller that even
  though a container is running, it should not receive any traffic from a proxy.
  Set a readiness check by configuring the
  `template.spec.containers.readinessprobe` stanza of a pod configuration.

It sounds complicated, but it really isn't. We will use the web console to add
these probes to our `nationalparks` application.

### Exercise: Add Health Checks
As we are going to be implementing a realistic CI/CD pipeline, we will be doing
some testing of the "development" version of the application. However, in order
to test the app, it must be ready. This is where OpenShift's application health
features come in very handy.

We are going to add both a readiness and liveness probe to the existing
`nationalparks` deployment. This will ensure that OpenShift does not add any
instances to the service until they pass the readiness checks, and will ensure
that unhealthy instances are restarted (if they fail the liveness checks).

Click *Applications* &rarr; *Deployments* on the left-side bar. Click
`nationalparks`. Click on `Configuration`.
You will see the warning about health checks, with a link to
click in order to add them.

Click *Add health checks* now.

You will want to click both *Add Readiness Probe* and *Add Liveness Probe* and
then fill them out as follows:

_Readiness Probe_

* Path: `/ws/healthz/`
* Initial Delay: `20`
* Timeout: `1`

_Liveness Probe_

* Path: `/ws/healthz/`
* Initial Delay: `120`
* Timeout: `1`

This is shown in the following image:

Once you have entered in the values show above, click *Save* and then click the *Overview* button in the left navigation. You
will notice that these changes caused a new deployment -- they counted as a
configuration change.

You will also notice that the circle around the new deployment stays light blue
for a while. This is a sign that the pod(s) have not yet passed their readiness
checks -- it's working!
