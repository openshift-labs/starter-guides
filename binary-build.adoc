## Lab: Binary Builds for Day to Day Development

### Moving on From S2I
As you saw before S2I is a great way to get from source code to a container, but the process is a bit too slow for daily fast iteration
development. For example, if you want to change some CSS or change one method in a class you don't want to go through
a full git commit and build cycle. In this lab we are going to show you a more efficient method for quick iteration. While
we are at it we will also throw in showing you how to debug your code as well.

Now that we built the MLB parks service let's go ahead and make some quick changes

### Fast Iteration Code Change Using Binary Deploy

The OpenShift command line has the ability to do a deployment from your local machine. In this case we are going to use S2I,
but we are going to tell OpenShift to just take the war file from our local machine and bake it in the image.

Doing this pattern of development let's us do quick builds on our local machine (benefitting from our local cache and
all the horsepower on our machine) and then just quickly send up the war file.

NOTE: You could also use this pattern to actually send up your working directory to the S2I builder to have it do the Maven build
on OpenShift. Using the local directory would relieve you from having Maven or any of the Java toolchain on your local
machine AND would also not require git commit with a push. Read more in the

#### Exercise: Using binary deployment

##### Clone source
The first step is to clone the MLB source code from GitHub to your local machine:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
git clone https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/mlbparks.git
----

NOTE: We are using Intellij here in the guide for screenshots but this should work regardless of your tool chain. JBoss
Developer Studio and JBoss Developer Tools have built in functionality that makes this close to seamless right from the IDE.

##### Setup the Build of the war file

**Maven**

If you have Maven all set up on your machine, then you can just do a


[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
mvn package
----

Pay attention to the output location for the ROOT.war, we will need that directory later.

**Intellij**

In Intellij, once the project is imported, we need to create a configuration to build an artifact

Go to Project Structure

image::binary-build-properties.png[Intellij Properties]

Then got to Modules, where you will see a notice that web facet resources is not included in the artifact. Click the "create
artifact" button, which will bring you to the next page in the process

image::binary-build-createartifact.png[Module Properties]

Now on this page, Intellij will try to create an exploded archive, we don't want that. So on the top right change the drop
down to _Web Application: Archive_. Then change the name to _ROOT_ which should also change the output layout to ROOT.war.
Finally, either change the output directory to the location you want for the war file or just note the location autogenerated.

Finally make sure to click Apply.

Now you can generate artifacts and it will make the ROOT.war file. Build artifacts is located under the build menu ( I have
mapped it to ctrl-shift-f10).

##### Code Change
Time for a source code change! Go to src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/rest/BackendController.java. This is the REST endpoint
that gives basic info on the service and can be reached at


[source,bash]
----
http://mlbparks-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/info/
----

Please change line 23 to add a _AMAZING_ in front of "MLB Parks" look like this:

[source,java]
----
return new Backend("mlbparks", "AMAZING MLB Parks", new Coordinates("39.82", "-98.57"), 5);
----

Don't forget to save the file.

#####  Doing the Binary Build

Alright we have our war file built, time to kick off a build using it.

If you built your war with Maven:
[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
oc start-build bc/mlbparks --from-file=target/ROOT.war --follow
----

NOTE: The --follow is optional if you want to follow the build output in your terminal.

For Intellij:
[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
oc start-build bc/mlbparks --from-file=location/you/put/in/output/ROOT.war --follow
----

NOTE: Change the file path above to the location you set in Intellij

When the build is finished and the container is deployed you should see the new content at:

[source,bash]
----
http://mlbparks-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/info/
----


So now you have seen how we can speed up the build and deploy process.
