In this lab, we're going to make our application visible to the end users, so they can access it.

== Background: Routes

While *Services* provide internal abstraction and load balancing within an
OpenShift environment, sometimes clients (users, systems, devices, etc.)
**outside** of OpenShift need to access an application. The way that external
clients are able to access applications running in OpenShift is through the
OpenShift routing layer. And the data object behind that is a *Route*.

The default OpenShift router (HAProxy) uses the HTTP header of the incoming
request to determine where to proxy the connection. You can optionally define
security, such as TLS, for the *Route*. If you want your *Services*, and, by
extension, your *Pods*, to be accessible from the outside world, you need to
create a *Route*.

== Exercise: Creating a Route

Fortunately, creating a *Route* is a pretty straight-forward process. You simply
`expose` the *Service* via the command line. Or, via the web console, just click
*Networking -> Routes* and then the *Create Route* button. Choose the *Service* you want to expose and enter values as shown in the following image:

When creating a *Route*, some other options can be provided, like the hostname for the *Route* or the TLS configuration for the *Route*.

When using the command line, we can first verify that we don't already have any existing *Routes*:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
oc get routes
----

[source,bash]
----
No resources found.
----

Now we need to get the *Service* name to expose:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
oc get services
----

[source,bash]
----
NAME       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
parksmap   172.30.169.213   <none>        8080/TCP   5h
----

Once we know the *Service* name, creating a *Route* is a simple one-command task:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
oc expose service parksmap
----

[source,bash]
----
route.route.openshift.io/parksmap exposed
----

Verify the *Route* was created with the following command:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
oc get route
----

[source,bash]
----
NAME       HOST/PORT                            PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION
parksmap   parksmap-{{ USER_PROJECT }}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}             parksmap   8080-tcp
----

You can also verify the *Route* by looking at the project in the OpenShift web console under *Networking -> Routes*:

Pretty nifty, huh?  This application is now available at the URL shown in the
web console. Click the link and you will see:
