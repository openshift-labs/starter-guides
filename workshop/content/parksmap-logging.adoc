OpenShift provides some convenient mechanisms for viewing application logs.
First and foremost is the ability to examine a *Pod*'s logs directly from the
web console or via the command line.

== Background: Container Logs

OpenShift is constructed in such a way that it expects containers to log all
information to `STDOUT`. In this way, both regular and error information is
captured via standardized Docker mechanisms. When exploring the *Pod*'s logs
directly, you are essentially going through the Docker daemon to access the
container's logs, through OpenShift's API.

[NOTE]
====
In some cases, applications may not have been designed to send all of their
information to `STDOUT` and `STDERR`. In many cases, multiple local log files
are used. While OpenShift cannot parse any information from these files, nothing
prevents them from being created, either. In other cases, log information is
sent to some external system. Here, too, OpenShift does not prohibit these
behaviors. If you have an application that does not log to `STDOUT`, either because it
already sends log information to some "external" system or because it writes
various log information to various files, fear not.

== Exercise: Examining Logs

Since we already deployed our application, we can take some time to examine its
logs. In the Developer Perspective, from Topology view, click the `parksmap` entry and then the *Resources* tab. You should see a *View Logs* link next to the *Pod* entry.

Click the *View Logs* link and you should see a nice view of the *Pod*'s logs:

WARNING: If you notice some errors in the log, that's okay. We'll remedy those in a little bit.

You also have the option of viewing logs from the command line. Get the name of
your *Pod*:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc get pods
----

[source,bash]
----
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-1-hx0kv   1/1       Running   0          5h
----

And then use the `logs` command to view this *Pod*'s logs:

[source,bash,role=copy-and-edit]
----
oc logs parksmap-1-hx0kv
----

You will see all of the application logs scroll on your screen:

[source,bash]

WARNING: If you scroll through the logs, you may notice an error that mentions a service account. What's that?  Never fear, we will cover that shortly.
