Containers are treated as immutable infrastructure and therefore it is generally
not recommended to modify the content of a container through SSH or running custom
commands inside the container. Nevertheless, in some use-cases, such as debugging
an application, it might be beneficial to get into a container and inspect the
application.

== Exercise: Remote Shell Session to a Container Using the CLI

OpenShift allows establishing remote shell sessions to a container without the
need to run an SSH service inside each container. In order to establish an
interactive session inside a container, you can use the `oc rsh` command. First
get the list of available pods:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc get pods
----

You should an output similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-65c4f8b676-fxcrq   1/1     Running   0          52m
----

Now you can establish a remote shell session into the pod by using the pod name:

[source,bash,role=copy-and-edit]
----
oc rsh parksmap-65c4f8b676-fxcrq
----

You would see the following output:

[source,bash]
----
sh-4.2$
----

[NOTE]
====
The default shell used by `oc rsh` is `/bin/sh`. If the deployed container does
not have *sh* installed and uses another shell, (e.g. *A Shell*) the shell command
can be specified after the pod name in the issued command.
====

Run the following command to list the files in the top folder:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
ls /
----

[source,bash]
----
anaconda-post.log  bin  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  parksmap.jar  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
----

== Exercise: Remote Shell Session to a Container Using the Web Console

The OpenShift Web Console also provides a convenient way to access a terminal session on the container without having to use the CLI.

In order to access a pod's terminal via the Web Console, go to the Topology view in the Developer Perspective, click the `parksmap` entry, and then click on the *Pod*.

Once you are viewing the information for the selected pod, click on the *Terminal* tab to open up a shell session.

Go ahead and execute the same commands you did when using the CLI to see how the Web Console based terminal behaves.

Before proceeding, close the connection to the pod.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
exit
----

== Exercise: Execute a Command in a Container

In addition to remote shell, it is also possible to run a command remotely in an
already running container using the `oc exec` command. This does not require
that a shell is installed, but only that the desired command is present and in
the executable path.

In order to show just the JAR file, run the following:

[source,bash,role=copy-and-edit]
----
oc exec parksmap-2-mcjsw -- ls -l /parksmap.jar
----

You would see something like the following:

[source,bash]
----
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 39138901 Apr  1 16:54 /parksmap.jar
----


[NOTE]
====
The `--` syntax in the `oc exec` command delineates where exec's options
end and where the actual command to execute begins. Take a look at `oc exec
--help` for more details.
====

You can also specify the shell commands to run directly with the *oc rsh* command:

[source,bash,role=copy-and-edit]
----
oc rsh parksmap-2-mcjsw whoami
----

You would see something like:

[source,bash]
----
1000580000
----

[NOTE]
====
It is important to understand that, for security reasons, OpenShift does not run containers as the user specified in the Dockerfile by default. In fact,
when OpenShift launches a container its user is actually randomized.

If you want or need to allow OpenShift users to deploy container images that do
expect to run as root (or any specific user), a small configuration change is
needed. You can learn more about the
