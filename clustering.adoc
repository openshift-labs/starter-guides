## Lab: Clustering Stateful Java EE Applications

### JBoss EAP Clustering

Clustering in JBoss EAP is achieved using the Kubernetes discovery mechanism for
finding other JBoss EAP containers and forming a cluster. This is done by
configuring the JGroups protocol stack in `standalone-openshift.xml` with
`<openshift.KUBE_PING/>` elements.

For `KUBE_PING` to work, the following steps must be taken:

. The `OPENSHIFT_KUBE_PING_NAMESPACE` environment variable must be set. If not
  set, the server will act as if it is a single-node cluster (a "cluster of
  one").
. The `OPENSHIFT_KUBE_PING_LABELS` environment variables should be set. If not
  set, pods outside of your application (albeit in your namespace) will try to
  join.
. Authorization must be granted to the service account the pod is running under
  to be allowed to access Kubernetes' REST api.

You have already configured the default service account to have access to
Kubernetes' REST api during previous labs. Now you can scale up the *mlbparks*
pod to two by clicking on the upper arrows on the console. Alternatively, you
can use the command line to scale up the pods and form a two-member cluster.

For pods based on Java images, the web console also exposes access to a
hawt.io-based JVM console for viewing and managing any relevant Java components.
A link is displayed in the pod's details on the *Applications* &rarr; *Pods* page,
provided the container has a port named jolokia. On the console, click on
mlbparks pods, then on any of the two pods deployed. On the *Details* tab, click
on *Open Java Console*.

In the Java Console, use the *JMX* browser and click on *jgroups &rarr; channel
&rarr; ee*. The right pane shows the list of clustering JMX attributes including
*view* which is the current state of the cluster. This attribute shows the name
of two pods which are currently members of the cluster. When *mlbparks* pod gets
scaled up or down, JBoss EAP gets notified by calling Kubernetes' REST API and
updates the cluster status based on the number of pods available.
