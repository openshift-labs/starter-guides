## Lab: Automating Deployment with CI/CD Pipeline

### Background: CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment refer to a set of practices with
the intention of automating various aspects of software delivery. One of these
practices is called a Pipeline.  A Pipeline is an automated process to define the steps a change
in code or configuration has to go through in order to reach promoted environments
such as staging and production. OpenShift supports CI/CD Pipelines by integrating
the popular https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/[Jenkins pipelines] into
the platform and enables defining truly complex workflows directly within OpenShift.

In a previous lab, you deployed the `nationalparks` application using the
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I)]
mechanism. S2I already provides build automation by automatically running builds
when the source code changes, or an underlying image changes. Deployments are also automated
by S2I and can be triggered when the image they are based on changes. In this lab,
you will create a more complex workflow by creating a pipeline that extends the S2I
functionality by adding more steps to the build and deploy process. The following
diagram shows the pipeline you will create in this lab.

image::pipeline-diagram.png[CI/CD Pipeline Diagram,800,align="center"]

There are two environments for the `nationalparks` application in this pipeline. Dev and Production (Live).
*Dev* is for development and test purposes where all code and
configuration changes are deployed so that you can run automated tests against it.
Furthermore, the test teams can run their manual tests on this container and
report any bugs discovered through their test cases. If the tests are all successful
and the _Deployment Manager_ in the team approves the change, it is then deployed to the
*Live* container which is the production environment with defined SLA and is
critical to function properly at all times.

The pipeline execution starts with a developer making a change in the application
code or configuration. For every change, the following steps are executed with the
goal of determining if the change is appropriate for deployment in the *Live*
environment:

. Clone the code from Git repo
. Build the code and run unit tests
. Build a docker image from the code (S2I)
. Deploy the docker image into *Dev*
. Run automated tests against the *Dev* deployment
. Run manual tests against the *Dev* deployment
. Wait for the *Deployment Manager* to either approve or reject the deployment (e.g. manual tests have revealed an unacceptable number of bugs)
. If approved, deploy to *Live*

Let's move on to deploy `Jenkins` and create this pipeline on OpenShift.

### Exercise: Deploy Jenkins

OpenShift provides a supported Jenkins image which includes a rich set of
plugins that enable the full pipeline flow. Click on the *Add to project*
button on the top right of your project overview page and then select *Browse Catalog*. Then, *CI/CD*:

image::pipeline-technologies-37.png[CI/CD Technologies]

Find the `jenkins-ephemeral` template, and click on it.  This will display a dialog 
where uou can customize the Jenkins properties such as service name, admin password, memory
allocation, etc through the parameters in the web console. We can leave all of
the default values, so click on *Next* until you get to the last screen of the dialog and then click on *Create* to deploy Jenkins.

OpenShift deploys a Jenkins pod and also creates a service and route for the
deployed container.

image::pipeline-jenkins-pods-37.png[Jenkins Pods]

After the readiness probe has passed and the Jenkins pod is blue, click on the Jenkins route in order to open the Jenkins Console. You will again
need to accept the certificate. The Jenkins image that is provided by Red Hat
uses an OAuth integration with OpenShift. Your OpenShift user credentials also
become the admin credentials for Jenkins:

image::pipeline-jenkins-credentials.png[Login with OpenShift]

Click *Login with OpenShift* and you will be taken to an OpenShift-branded login
screen. Use your username (_{{USER_NAME}}_) and password (_{{USER_PASSWORD}}_) to
access Jenkins. You will then be prompted to grant access:

image::pipeline-jenkins-permissions-37.png[Grant Jenkins Permissions]

Click *Allow selected permissions*.

image::pipeline-jenkins-console.png[Jenkins Console]

### Exercise: Remove Dev from `parksmap`
Since we are going to be replacing the current `nationalparks` application with
a *Live* version, we should remove the *Dev* version from the `parksmap` by
taking away the *Route* label:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc label route nationalparks type-
----

### Exercise: Create Live Environment

Before creating the pipeline, you need to create a *Live* deployment that runs
the live version of `nationalparks` application. The `parksmap` front-end will
talk to the *Live* `nationalparks`. This allows developers to make frequent
changes in the *Dev* deployment without interfering with the live application.

#### Live MongoDB
First you need to create a new MongoDB deployment for the *Live* environment. In the
web console in your `{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` project,  click the *Add to
Project* button, and then find the `mongodb-ephemeral` template, and click it.
Use the following values in their respective fields:

* Database Service Name : `mongodb-live`
* MongoDB Connection Username : `mongodb`
* MongoDB Connection Password : `mongodb`
* MongoDB Database Name: `mongodb`
* MongoDB Admin Password : `mongodb`

Add the following label

* app: nationalparks-live

You can leave the rest of the values as their defaults, and then click
*Create*. Then click *Continue to overview*. The MongoDB instance should
quickly be deployed. If you're interested, take a look at Mongo's logs to see
what it does when it starts up.

{% if modules.configmap %}

#### Live ConfigMap
The database configuration for the *Dev* `nationalparks` webservice was changed
to use *ConfigMaps* in a previous lab. Similarly, we will use a *ConfigMap* for
`nationalparks-live`. Download the live properties file to your local machine
and create a distinct *ConfigMap*. The file is located here:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks/raw/{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}}/ose3/application-live.properties
----

Then, run the following command to create the live *ConfigMap*:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc create configmap nationalparks-live --from-file=application.properties=./application-live.properties
----
{% endif %}

#### Live Deployment
Now you can create the *Live* deployment based on the same `nationalparks`
Docker image created in link:java[previous labs]. Click on *Builds* &rarr;
*Images* and then `nationalparks` to inspect the *ImageStream*.

image::pipeline-live-image.png[National Parks Image Stream]

The default behavior for OpenShift has every
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html[S2I
build] creating a new Docker image that is pushed into the internal registry,
identified with the `latest` tag. Since we do not want to immediately run or
deploy the *Live* version of `nationalparks` when the image changes, we want the
ability for the *Dev* and *Live* deployments to run different versions of the
`nationalparks` image simultaneously. This will allow developers to continue
changing and deploying *Dev* without affecting the *Live* environment. In
order to achieve that, you will create a new Docker image tag using the CLI.
This new tag will be what the *Live* deployment will look for changes to:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc tag nationalparks:latest nationalparks:live
----

You should have seen a change on the *ImageStream* page in the UI.

This command says "please use the existing image that the tag
`nationalparks:latest` points to and also point it at `nationalparks:live`." Or,
in other words "create a new tag (`live`) that points to whatever `latest`
points to.

While _new_ builds will update the `latest` tag, only a manual command (or an
automated workflow, like we will implement with Jenkins) will update the `live`
tag. The `live` tag keeps referring to the pervious Docker image and therefore
leaves the *Live* environment intact.

After creating the tag, you are ready to deploy the *Live* `nationalparks` based
on the `nationalparks:live` image tag. In the web console in your
`{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` project,  click the *Add to Project* button, and then
*Deploy Image* tab. Choose the *Image Stream Tag* radio button and use following
values in each respective field:

* Namespace: `{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}`
* ImageStream: `nationalparks`
* Tag: `live`

Once you make your three dropdown selections in the *Image Stream Tag* area,
you will see the rest of the standard deployment options "open up".

There are only a few things to change:

* Name: `nationalparks-live`

[WARNING]
====
If you forget to change the name to `nationalparks-live` you will get an error
about resources already existing -- because they do. `nationalparks` already
exists as our *Dev* Deployment.
====

{% if modules.configmap %}

image::pipeline-live-deploy-config.png[National Parks Live Deploy]

{% else %}

Specify the following environment variable to wire the *Live* container to the
*Live* database:

* `MONGODB_SERVER_HOST`: `mongodb-live`
* `MONGODB_USER`: `mongodb`
* `MONGODB_PASSWORD`: `mongodb`
* `MONGODB_DATABASE`: `mongodb`

image::pipeline-live-deploy-env.png[National Parks Live Deploy]

{% endif %}

You can leave the rest of the values as their defaults, and then click
*Create*. Then click *Continue to overview*.

{% if modules.configmap %}

#### Attach ConfigMap
Deploying the `nationalparks-live` image through the UI did not utilize the
*ConfigMap*, so we have one more step -- to tell OpenShift where to put the
properties file. Since you have already created the *ConfigMap*, all you have to
do is use the `oc set volumes` command to put it in the right place:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc set volumes dc/nationalparks-live --add -m /deployments/config --configmap-name=nationalparks-live
----

{% endif %}

#### Add Route
If you look at the web console, you will notice that, when you create the
application this way, OpenShift doesn't create a *Route* for you. Click on
*Create Route* on the top right corner of *NATIONALPARKS LIVE* and
then *Create* to create a route with the default values.

Similar to the link:databases[previous labs], populate the database by pointing your browser to the
`nationalparks-live` route url:

[source,bash]
----
http://nationalparks-live-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/data/load
----

NOTE: If the application has not been deployed yet, you might get a __502 Bad Gateway error webpage__. This 
means that the application backing up the route is not yet ready. Wait until the pod is up. 

#### Label Service
As discussed in link:databases[previous labs], the `parksmap` web app queries the OpenShift API and
looks for routes that have the label `type=parksmap-backend` and interrogates the
discovered endpoints to visualize their map data. After creating the pipeline,
`parksmap` should use the *Live* container instead of the *Dev* container so that
deployments to the *Dev* container does not disrupt the `parksmap` application.
You can do that by removing the `type` label from the *Dev* route and adding it
to the *Live* route:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc label route nationalparks-live type=parksmap-backend
----

{% if DISABLE_NATIONALPARKS_DEPLOYMENT_PIPELINE %}
### Exercise: Disable Automatic Deployment of nationalparks (dev)
When we created the `nationalparks` build earlier in the workshop, OpenShift
configured the deployment of the image to occur automatically whenever the
`:latest` tag was updated.

In our pipeline example, Jenkins is going to handle telling OpenShift to deploy
the dev version of `nationalparks` if it builds successfully. In order to
prevent two deployments, we will need to disable automatic deployments with a
simple CLI statement:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc set triggers dc/nationalparks --from-image=nationalparks:latest --remove
----

{% endif %}

### Exercise: Create OpenShift Pipeline

The Pipeline is in fact a type of build that allows developers to define a Jenkins
pipeline for execution by the Jenkins pipeline plugin. The build can be started,
monitored, and managed by {{OPENSHIFT_NAME}} in the same way as any other
build type. Pipeline workflows are defined in a Jenkinsfile, either embedded directly
in the build configuration, or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the
build configuration.

In order to create the pipeline, click on the *Add to project* button,
find the `dev-live-pipeline` template, and click on it. Specify the project name
and click on *Create*

image::pipeline-template.png[Pipeline Template]

You will need to specify:

* the name of the project (e.g. `{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}`) where
`nationalparks` *Dev* and *Live* containers are deployed.
* Label 
** app: nationalparks-live 

In order to start the pipeline that you created in a previous step, Go to
*Builds* &rarr; *Pipelines* on the left side-bar. Click `nationalparks-pipeline`
and click on *Start Pipeline* to start the execution.  You can click on *View
Log* to take a look at the build logs as they progress through the pipeline or
on *Build #N* to see the details of this specific pipeline execution as well as
the pipeline definition using the
https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/[Jenkins DSL].

image::pipeline-details.png[Pipeline Details]

Because of the way the pipeline was defined, if you return to the overview page
you will also see the pipeline status there, associated with the relevant
deployments:

image::pipeline-deploy-dev.png[Pipeline - Deploy to Dev]

Pipeline execution will pause after running automated tests against the *Dev*
container. Visit the `nationalparks` *Dev* web service to query for data and
verify the service works as expected.

[source,bash]
----
http://nationalparks-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/data/all
----

NOTE: If the application has not been deployed yet, you might get a __502 Bad Gateway error webpage__. This 
means that the application backing up the route is not yet ready. Wait until the pod is up. 

After the test stage, pipeline waits for manual approval in order to deploy to the
*Live* container.

image::pipeline-input.png[Manual Approval]

Click on *Input Required* link which takes you to the Jenkins Console for approving
the deployment. This step typically will be integrated into your workflow process
(e.g. JIRA Service Desk and ServiceNow) and will be performed as part of the overall
deployment process without interacting directly with Jenkins. For simplicity in
this lab, click on *Proceed* button to approve the build.

image::pipeline-jenkins-input.png[Jenkins Approval,1000,align=center]

Pipeline execution continues to promote and deploy the `nationalparks` image.
This is achieved by tagging the image that was just built and tested as "live",
which causes the `imagechange` trigger on the *Live* deployment to act. This
likely already happened before you finished reading this paragraph.

In *Builds* &rarr; *Pipelines*, click on *View History* to go to the pipeline overview
which shows the pipeline execution history as well as build time metrics so that you can
iteratively improve the build process as well detect build time anomalies which usually
signal a bad change in the code or configuration.

NOTE: Build metrics are generated and displayed after a few executions of the pipeline
to determine trends.

image::pipeline-history.png[OpenShift History]

Congratulations! Now you have a CI/CD Pipeline for the `nationalparks`
application. If you visit the parks map again, you should see the map points!
