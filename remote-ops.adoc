## Lab: Remote Operations

### Background

Containers are treated as immutable infrastructure and therefore it is generally
not recommended to modify the content of a container through SSH or running custom
commands inside the container. Nevertheless, in some use-cases, such as debugging
an application, it might be beneficial to get into a container and inspect the
application.

#### Exercise: Remote Shell Session to a Container Using the CLI

OpenShift allows establishing remote shell sessions to a container without the
need to run an SSH service inside each container. In order to establish an
interactive session inside a container, you can use the `oc rsh` command. First
get the list of available pods:

[source]
----
$ oc get pods
----

You should an output similar to the following:

[source]
----
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-2-tegp4   1/1       Running   0          2m
----

Now you can establish a remote shell session into the pod by using the pod name:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
$ oc rsh parksmap-2-tegp4
----

You would see the following output:

[source]
----
sh-4.2$
----

[NOTE]
====
The default shell used by `oc rsh` is `/bin/sh`. If the deployed container does
not have *sh* installed and uses another shell, (e.g. *A Shell*) the shell command
can be specified after the pod name in the issued command.
====

Run the following command to list the files in the top folder:

[source]
----
$ ls /

anaconda-post.log  bin  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  parksmap.jar  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
----

#### Exercise: Remote Shell Session to a Container Using the Web Console

The OpenShift Web Console also provides a convenient way to access a terminal session on the container without having to use the CLI.

In order to access a pods terminal via the Web Console, click on "Applications", then "Pods" and finally the pod name as shown in the following image:

image::applications-pods.png[Pod List]

Once you are viewing the information for the selected pod, click on the "Terminal" tab to open up a shell session.

Pretty nifty!  Go ahead and execute the same commands you did when using the CLI to see how the Web Console based terminal behaves.


#### Exercise: Execute a Command in a Container

In addition to remote shell, it is also possible to run a command remotely in an
already running container using the `oc exec` command. This does not require
that a shell is installed, but only that the desired command is present and in
the executable path.

{% if PARKSMAP_PY %}

In order to list all files in the main directory, run the following:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
$ oc exec parksmap-2-tegp4 -- ls -l 
----

You would see a listing of all of the files in the current directory on the remote container.

{% else %}
In order to show just the JAR file, run the following:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
$ oc exec parksmap-2-tegp4 -- ls -l /parksmap.jar
----

You would see something like the following:

[source]
----
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 21753918 Nov 23 15:54 /parksmap.jar
----
{% endif %}



[NOTE]
====
The `--` syntax in the `oc exec` command delineates where exec's options
end and where the actual command to execute begins. Take a look at `oc exec
--help` for more details.
====

You can also specify the shell commands to run directly with the *oc rsh* command:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
$ oc rsh parksmap-2-tegp4 whoami
----

You would see something like:

[source]
----
whoami: cannot find name for user ID 1000060000
error: error executing remote command: error executing command in container: Error executing in Docker Container: 1
----

[NOTE]
====
It is important to understand that, for security reasons, OpenShift does not run
Docker containers as the user specified in the Dockerfile by default. In fact,
when OpenShift launches a container its user is actually randomized.

If you want or need to allow OpenShift users to deploy Docker images that do
expect to run as root (or any specific user), a small configuration change is
needed. You can learn more about the
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/creating_images/guidelines.html[Docker guidelines]
for OpenShift, or you can look at the section on
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/admin_guide/manage_scc.html#enable-images-to-run-with-user-in-the-dockerfile[enabling
images to run with a USER in the dockerfile].
