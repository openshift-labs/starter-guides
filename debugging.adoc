## Lab: Setting up Debugging

### Background: Port Forwarding and Debugging
Just as we did before with remote shelling into our pods, we can also set up a port-forward between our local machine
and our pod. The is useful for operations like connecting to a database running in a pod, viewing an administrative web
interface we don't want to expose to the public, or, in our case, attach a debugger to the JVM running our application
server.

You can read more about port-forwarding from the
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/dev_guide/port_forwarding.html[developer documentation].

By port forwarding the debugging port for the application server, we can attach the debugger from our IDE and actually
step through the code in the pod as it is running in real time. By default EAP is not in debug mode, therefore we first
need to turn on the debug ports


### Exercise: Enabling Debugging in EAP on OpenShift

It is very simple to turn on debugging. The EAP S2I container we are using is looking for an environment variable to
control whether or not to enable the debug port. All we need to do is set an environment variable for the deployment.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc set env dc/mlbparks DEBUG=true
----

This will force a redeploy of our MLB park pod, this time with the JDWT transport enabled and serving on port 8787.

### Exercise: Port-Forwarding from the pod to our local machine

It is quite simple to do port-forwarding.

First get the pods:
[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
NAME                       READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
mlbparks-1-build           0/1       Completed   0          9m
mlbparks-2-7c6zb           1/1       Running     0          4m
mongodb-mlbparks-1-887pq   1/1       Running     0          8m
parksmap-2-wms5l           1/1       Running     0          13m
----

Now we are all set to set up the port-forward:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc port-forward mlbparks-2-7c6zb 8787:8787
----

We said to port-forward from port 8787 on the pod to 8787 on the local machine. Now we can attach a remote debugger.

NOTE: To stop port-forwarding just hit ctrl-c in the terminal window where you did the port forward command

### Setting up Remote Debug in Intellij

Setting up remote debugging is quite easy in Intellij. First edit the run/debug configurations.
Under the Run menu (alt-u), choose edit configurations. This will bring up the new configuration dialog.

Click the plus in the top left corner, scroll down, and choose remote.

On the resulting dialog page, change the name at the top to "on OpenShift" or whatever is informative to you. Then
towards the bottom right, change the port number to 8787. When you have done that click "OK".

Now when you click the Debug icon in Intellij, it will open the debugger and attach to JVM in the pod on OpenShift. Go
ahead and set a break point in any class you want and it will do normal debugging - just like you know and love!
