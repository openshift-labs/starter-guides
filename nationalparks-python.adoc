In this lab, we're going to deploy a backend service, developed in Python
that will expose 2 main REST endpoints to the visualizer
application (`parksmap` web component that was deployed in the previous labs).
The application will query for national parks information (including its
coordinates) that is stored in a MongoDB database.  This application will also
provide an external access point, so that the API provided can be directly used
by the end user.

== Background: Source-to-Image (S2I)

In a previous lab, we learned how to deploy a pre-existing container
image. Now we will expand on that by learning how OpenShift builds
 images using source code from an existing repository.  This is accomplished using the Source-to-Image project.

https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is a
open source project sponsored by Red Hat that has the following goal:

[source]
----
Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible images. S2I
produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a container image and
assembling a new container image which incorporates the builder image and built
source. The result is then ready to use with docker run. S2I supports
incremental builds which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously
built artifacts, etc.
----

OpenShift is S2I-enabled and can use S2I as one of its build mechanisms (in
addition to building container images from Dockerfiles, and "custom" builds).

OpenShift runs the S2I process inside a special *Pod*, called a Build
Pod, and thus builds are subject to quotas, limits, resource scheduling, and
other aspects of OpenShift.

A full discussion of S2I is beyond the scope of this class, but you can find
more information about it either in the
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/creating_images/s2i.html[OpenShift S2I documentation]
or on https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[GitHub]. The only key concept you need to
remember about S2I is that it's magic.

== Exercise: Creating a Python application

The backend service that we will be deploying as part of this exercise is
called `nationalparks`.  This is a python application that performs 2D
geo-spatial queries against a MongoDB database to locate and return map
coordinates of all National Parks in the world. That was just a fancy way of
saying that we are going to deploy a webservice that returns a JSON list of
places.

=== Add to Project
Because the `nationalparks` component is a backend to serve data that our
existing frontend (parksmap) will consume, we are going to build it inside the existing
project that we have been working with. To illustrate how you can interact with OpenShift via the CLI or the Web Console, we will deploy the nationalparks component using the web console.

=== Using application code on embedded Git server

OpenShift can work with any accessible Git repository. This could be GitHub,
GitLab, or any other server that speaks Git. You can even register webhooks in
your Git server to initiate OpenShift builds triggered by any update to the
application code!

The repository that we are going to use is already cloned in the internal Gogs repository
and located at the following URL:

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `{{ USER_NAME }}` with the Gogs username provided to you. Your Gogs credentials are the same as your OpenShift credentials.

[source,role=copypaste]
----
http://gogs-{{INFRA_PROJECT}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{ USER_NAME }}/nationalparks.git
----

Later in the lab, we want you to make a code change and then rebuild your
application. This is a fairly simple Python application.

=== Build the Code on OpenShift

Similar to how we used "Add to project" before with an existing image, we
can do the same for specifying a source code repository. Since for this lab you
have your own git repository, let's use it with a simple Python S2I image.

CAUTION: In the following step(s), replace `{{ USER_PROJECT }}` with the project provided to you.

In the OpenShift web console, find your `{{ USER_PROJECT }}` project, and then
click the *"Add to Project"* button and then the browse catalog link as highlighted in the following image:

image::nationalparks-show-catalog.png[Add to Project]

This is the service catalog which allows a user to select components they want to add to their application.

Search for `python`, and finally select "Python" as shown in the following image:

image::nationalparks-python-sarch-python.png[Service Catalog Languages]

After you click `Python`, a dialog is presented as shown in the following image:

image::nationalparks-python-new-python-service.png[Add application]

Click on the "Next" button and then enter a name and a Git repository URL. For the name, enter `nationalparks`,
and for the Git repository URL, enter:

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `{{ USER_NAME }}` with the Git username provided to you.

[source,role=copypaste]
----
http://gogs-{{INFRA_PROJECT}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{ USER_NAME }}/nationalparks.git
----

NOTE: All of these runtimes shown are made available via *Templates* and
*ImageStreams*, which will be discussed in a later lab.

In the *Git Repository* field enter the base of the Git repository for
your `nationalparks` application. This will cause the S2I
process to grab that specific tag in the code repository.

If you were to specify a specific branch or directory in the repository for your code, you would be able to do it in the *Advanced Options*. 

Don't click *Create*, but click on *Advanced Options*, as there are more things we are going to configure.

image::nationalparks-python-configure-python-service.png[Runtimes]

We will again set 3 labels to the deployment.

- *__app__=workshop*  (the name we will be giving to the app)
- *__component__=nationalparks*  (the name of this deployment)
- *__role__=backend* (the role this component plays in the overall application)

image::nationalparks-configure-service-labels.png[Adding labels]

You can then hit the button labeled *"Create"*. Then click *Continue to
overview* and toggle the *>* icon next to the deployment config for `nationalparks`. You will see the build log output directly there.

image::nationalparks-python-new-python-build.png[Nationalparks build]

The initial build will take a few minutes to downloads all of the dependencies needed for
the application. You can see all of this happening in real time!

From the command line, you can also see the *Builds*:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
oc get builds
----

You'll see output like:

[source,bash]
----
NAME              TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED              DURATION
nationalparks-1   Source    Git@b052ae6   Running    About a minute ago   1m2s
----

You can also view the build logs with the following command:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
oc logs -f builds/nationalparks-1
----

After the build has completed and successfully:

* The S2I process will push the resulting container image to the internal OpenShift registry
* The *DeploymentConfiguration* (DC) will detect that the image has changed, and this
  will cause a new deployment to happen.
* A *ReplicationController* (RC) will be spawned for this new deployment.
* The RC will detect no *Pods* are running and will cause one to be deployed, as our default replica count is just 1.

In the end, when issuing the `oc get pods` command, you will see that the build Pod
has finished (exited) and that an application *Pod* is in a ready and running state:

[source,bash]
----
NAME                    READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nationalparks-1-tkid3   1/1       Running     3          2m
nationalparks-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          3m
parksmap-1-4hbtk        1/1       Running     0          2h
----

If you look again at the web console, you will notice that, when you create the
application this way, OpenShift also creates a *Route* for you. You can see the
URL in the web console, or via the command line:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
oc get routes
----

Where you should see something like the following:

[source,bash]
----
NAME            HOST/PORT                                                   PATH      SERVICES        PORT       TERMINATION
nationalparks   nationalparks-{{ USER_PROJECT }}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}             nationalparks   8080-tcp
parksmap        parksmap-{{ USER_PROJECT }}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}                  parksmap        8080-tcp
----

In the above example, the URL is:

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `{{ USER_PROJECT }}` with the project provided to you.

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
http://nationalparks-{{ USER_PROJECT }}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}
----

Since this is a backend application, it doesn't actually have a web interface.
However, it can still be used with a browser. All backends that work with the parksmap
frontend are required to implement a `/ws/info/` endpoint. To test, the
complete URL to enter in your browser is:

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `{{ USER_PROJECT }}` with the project provided to you.

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
http://nationalparks-{{ USER_PROJECT }}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/info/
----

WARNING: The trailing slash is *required*.

You will see a simple JSON string:

[source,json]
----
{"id":"nationalparks-py","displayName":"National Parks (PY)","center":{"latitude":"47.039304","longitude":"14.505178"},"zoom":4}
----

Earlier we said:

[source,bash]
----
This is a Python application that performs 2D geo-spatial queries
against a MongoDB database
----

But we don't have a database. Yet.
