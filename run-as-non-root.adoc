== Lab: Running Your Images as a Non-Root User

If you look at most of the images on Dockerhub they run as the root user - so if yours
does as well you have a lot of company. Unfortunately this is a bad security practice.
You don't run your desktop as a "root" user and especially not on your servers, so there
is no reason you should do it on your containers. All those same reasons that warn against
running as an account with admin priveliges still apply in Docker land.

Running in OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Online, and OpenShift dedicated requires
that your container be able to run as a random non-admin userid. For our class we are going
to use a simple example.

=== Making a CentOS Apache HTTPD Image

We are going to start with a CentOS image and Apache HTTPD to the image. Since you have
already built Docker images before I will just give you the GitHub repo. with my simple
image:

https://github.com/thesteve0/myDockerImages/tree/master/simple

Here is the Dockerfile with the comments removed:

[source, Dockerfile]
-----
FROM centos:centos7

MAINTAINER Steve Pousty <thesteve0@redhat.com>

RUN yum install -y --setopt=tsflags=nodocs httpd.x86_64 && yum clean all -y

EXPOSE 80

CMD /usr/sbin/apachectl -DFOREGROUND

#docker run -p 80:80 6e3c25bdca9b
-----

You should be able to run this no problem on your machine. If we push this to Dockerhub we
can actually run this in the A1VM since the OpenShift cluster does not enforce most
of the security policies.

First we need to push the image to DockerHub

[source, terminal]
----
$ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: thesteve0
Password:
Login Succeeded
$ docker push thesteve0/centoshttpd

----

Now with our command line we run this in OpenShift with the OC command line tools:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc login  #your username and password can be anything you want
$ oc new-project mydockerimages
$ oc new-app thesteve0/centoshttpd
--> Found Docker image 6e3c25b (4 days old) from Docker Hub for "thesteve0/centoshttpd"

    * An image stream will be created as "centoshttpd:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "centoshttpd"
    * Port 80/tcp will be load balanced by service "centoshttpd"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "centoshttpd"
    * WARNING: Image "thesteve0/centoshttpd" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

--> Creating resources with label app=centoshttpd ...
    imagestream "centoshttpd" created
    deploymentconfig "centoshttpd" created
    service "centoshttpd" created
--> Success
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

Let's go ahead and discuss what we just did. Oc new-app realizes we have passed it a Docker image
and does "the right thing" to get this image running in OpenShift. It creates:

1. An Image Stream
2. A Deployment Configuration
3. A Service

The Deployment Configuration uses the Image Stream to determin the Docker image to pull, pulls it,
and then spins up the pod with our image running in it as a container.

You can also log into the web console to look at what we created:

https://{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}/console

Just use the same username and password as you used in the command line.

TIP: If your first deploy fails it may be because the Docker image does now download in time to the node. Please
just trigger another deploy.

==== What is the User For Our Pod

In the web console - go to the running pod and then click on the terminal tab.

image::terminal.png[]

This is a terminal into your pod. Go ahead and click on the terminal and then type in `$ whoami`.
You will see that you are running your container as root.


=== Switching the User

Our first task in getting this ready is making the image run as non-root. Actually to run in OpenShift
you need the image to be ok with running as a randomly assigned user. We are going modify our Docker
image to be a random users. There are several things we need
to do to get there
. Since we can't bind to port 80 as a non-root user we need to change the port for Apache HTTPD. We will
also need to change the user we run as. Finally then we will need to see what this breaks.

Here is the Github repo with my new docker image:

https://github.com/thesteve0/myDockerImages/tree/master/simpleNoRoot

Let's go through the following items together

1. Modify httpd.conf to serve over port 8080. While we do this we will also modify logging to pipe to stdout
2. Expose 8080 rather than 80
3. Run as user 1001
4. This turns out to cause a problem with file permissions for creating the httpd.pid. Which then exposes
a bug in Docker

At the end of this we now have a docker image that does not need root to run.

After we build, We can test this by running our docker image like so:

[source, bash]
----

docker run -p 8080:8080 -u 1234 mydockerimage

----

If it runs no problem then we are all set to run on OpenShift.

We can build and push this to Dockerhub and then run it in OpenShift like last time.

[source, bash]
----

$ oc new-app thesteve0/noroot
--> Found Docker image 439b966 (4 days old) from Docker Hub for "thesteve0/noroot"

    * An image stream will be created as "noroot:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "noroot"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "noroot"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "noroot"

--> Creating resources with label app=noroot ...
    imagestream "noroot" created
    deploymentconfig "noroot" created
    service "noroot" created
--> Success
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

Voila, the root warning is gone. From my teams experience the biggest place we find problems
with being non-root, or a random userid, is actually with file permissions

=== What if I need a user to be in the /etc/passwd table

Sometimes an application will look up the user in the password table which won't
work given the way I have just shown you. For example you need a username and not just an id.
To handle you can use NSS Wrappers to do the work in your image.

I am not going to talk through it much here but we will look at some example Docker images
that take advantage of NSS wrappers.

Jenkins Image does this with NSS wrapper example
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/1/Dockerfile.rhel7
OpenShift assigns a random UID when we start up jenkins and it runs this script (along with others)
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/1/contrib/s2i/run#L29-L31

And this adds the random UID to the NSS passwords file so the app can find it there
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/1/contrib/jenkins/jenkins-common.sh#L12-L29

=== Pulling New Images from Dockerhub Into OpenShift

As you iteratively work on your image you will probably push to Dockerhub often. To get
OpenShift to pick up the new images you need to modify your DeploymentConfig to always
pull new images on deployment.

By default the DeploymentConfig has its _imagePullPolicy_ set to _Always_ if we use the tag latest (which
we are doing in this case). This means everytime we do a deploy we do a pull request to Dockerhub (or whatever
registry we are using) but we may not pull any bits if there are no changes.
Here is some https://docs.openshift.org/dev_guide/managing_images.html#image-pull-policy[documentation].

=== Next steps

And with that we have:

1. Gotten our image to run as a random UUID
2. Made our image log to stdout

The final things we absolutely need to make it do is use volumes for changing content.
So let's go to the next section and get going!
