## Lab: Deploying Python Code

### Application Description
In this lab, we're going to deploy a backend service, developed in Python
programming language that will expose 2 main REST endpoints to the visualizer
application (`parksmap` web component that was deployed in the previous labs).
The application will query for national parks information (including it's
coordinates) that is stored in a Mongo database.
This application will also provide an external access point, so that the API
provided can be directly used by the end user.

### Background: Source-to-Image (S2I)

In a previous lab, we learned how to deploy a pre-existing Docker-formatted
image. Now we will expand on that a bit by learning how OpenShift builds
Docker images using source code from an existing repository.

https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is another
open source project sponsored by Red Hat. Its goal:

__
Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible Docker images. S2I
produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a Docker image and
assembling a new Docker image which incorporates the builder image and built
source. The result is then ready to use with docker run. S2I supports
incremental builds which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously
built artifacts, etc.
__

OpenShift is S2I-enabled and can use S2I as one of its build mechanisms (in
addition to building Docker images from Dockerfiles, and "custom" builds).

OpenShift runs the S2I process inside a special *Pod*, called a Build
Pod, and thus builds are subject to quotas, limits, resource scheduling, and
other aspects of OpenShift.

A full discussion of S2I is beyond the scope of this class, but you can find
more information about it either in the
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/creating_images/s2i.html[OpenShift S2I documentation]
or on GitHub (following the link above). The only key concept you need to
remember about S2I is that it's magic.

### Exercise: Creating a Python application

The backend service that we will be deploying as part of this exercise is
called `nationalparks`.  This is a Python application that performs 2D
geo-spatial queries against a MongoDB database to locate and return map
coordinates of all National Parks in the world. That was just a fancy way of
saying that we are going to deploy a webservice that returns a JSON list of
places.

#### Add to Project
Because the `nationalparks` application is a back-end to serve data that our
existing front-end will consume, we are going to build it inside the existing
`{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` project. And, we will do it from the
web console.

#### Using application code

OpenShift can work with any accessible Git repository. This could be GitHub,
GitLab, or any other server that speaks Git. You can even register webhooks in
your Git server to initiate OpenShift builds triggered by any update to the
application code!

{% if GIT_HOST == "github" %}
The repository that we are going to use is available at Github.com

https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/nationalparks-py[https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/nationalparks-py]

NOTE: To be able to do code changes later in the workshop, you should fork the
repository into your own Github account.

{% else %}
The repository that we are going to use is already cloned in the internal GitLab repository
and located at the following URL:

http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks-py/tree/{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}}[http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks-py/tree/{{NATIONALPARKS_VERSION}}]

Your GitLab credentials are: *{{GITLAB_USER}}/{{GITLAB_PASSWORD}}*

Later in the lab, we want you to make a code change and then rebuild your
application. This is a fairly simple Python application.
{% endif %}

#### Build the Code on OpenShift

While the `new-app` command makes it very easy to get OpenShift to build code
from a GitHub/GitLab repository into a Docker image, we can also use the web
console to do the same thing. Similar to how we used "Add to project" before
with a Docker-formatted image, we can do the same for specifying a source code
repository.
{% if GIT_HOST == "github" %} You have already forked the Github repository so
let's use it with a simple Python S2I image.
{% else %} Since for this lab you have your own GitLab repository let's use it
with a simple Python S2I image.
{% endif %}

In the OpenShift web console, find your
`{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` project, and then
click on `Browse Catalog` in the *"Add to Project"* drop down.
You will see a number of technologies and runtimes that you
can choose from.
Search for `python` and select it.

image::ocp-runtimes-python.png[Runtimes]

After you select `python`, click `Next` and on the next screen choose version `3.6`, you will need to enter a
name and a Git repository URL. For the name, enter `nationalparks`, and for
the Git repository URL, enter:

[source,bash]
----
{% if GIT_HOST == "github" %}
https://github.com/(your Github username)/nationalparks-py.git
{% else %}
http://{{GITLAB_URL_PREFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{GITLAB_USER}}/nationalparks-py.git
{% endif %}
----

NOTE: All of these runtimes shown are made available via *Templates* and
*ImageStreams*, which will be discussed in a later lab.

image::new-national-parks-1-py.png[Runtimes]

{% if modules.pipelines %}

These labs were written against specific points in time for these
applications. With Git as our version control system (VCS), we are using the
concept of *Branches/Tags*. Click on *Show advanced routing, build, and deployment
options*. In the *Git Reference* field enter "1.0.0". This will cause the S2I
process to grab that specific tag in the code repository.

image::nationalparks-tag-py.png[Runtimes]

{% endif %}

You can then hit the button labeled *"Create"*. Then click *Continue to
overview*. You will see the build logs right there:

image::overview-build-log.png[Build log]

From the command line, you can also see the *Builds*:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get builds
----

You'll see output like:

[source,bash]
----
NAME              TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED              DURATION
nationalparks-1   Source    Git@b052ae6   Running    About a minute ago   1m2s
----

You can also view the build logs with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc logs -f builds/nationalparks-1
----

After the build has completed and successfully:

* The S2I process will push the resulting Docker-formatted image to the internal OpenShift registry
* The *DeploymentConfiguration* (DC) will detect that the image has changed, and this
  will cause a new deployment to happen.
* A *ReplicationController* (RC) will be spawned for this new deployment.
* The RC will detect no *Pods* are running and will cause one to be deployed, as our default replica count is just 1.

In the end, when issuing the `oc get pods` command, you will see that the build Pod
has finished (exited) and that an application *Pod* is in a ready and running state:

[source,bash]
----
NAME                    READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nationalparks-1-tkid3   1/1       Running     3          2m
nationalparks-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          3m
parksmap-1-4hbtk        1/1       Running     0          2h
----

If you look again at the web console, you will notice that, when you create the
application this way, OpenShift also creates a *Route* for you. You can see the
URL in the web console, or via the command line:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get routes
----

Where you should see something like the following:

[source,bash]
----
NAME            HOST/PORT                                                   PATH      SERVICES        PORT       TERMINATION
nationalparks   nationalparks-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}             nationalparks   8080-tcp
parksmap        parksmap-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}                  parksmap        8080-tcp
----

In the above example, the URL is:

[source,bash]
----
http://nationalparks-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}
----

Since this is a back-end application, it doesn't actually have a web interface.
However, it can give us some data. All back ends that work with the parks map
front end are required to implement a `/ws/info/` endpoint. To test, the
complete URL to enter in your browser is:

[source,bash]
----
http://nationalparks-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/info/
----

WARNING: The trailing slash is *required*.

You will see a simple JSON string:

[source,json]
----
{"id":"nationalparks","displayName":"National Parks","center":{"latitude":"47.039304","longitude":"14.505178"},"zoom":4}
----
